While most celebrities, past and present, have never taken a personality test, psychologists who are knowledgeable about typology believe they know what the outcomes would be.\nMost politicians, entertainers, and leaders of large organizations are extraverts. Introverts are usually deep thinkers, complex individuals who can be charming in public but are private in their personal lives. Introverts aren’t easily categorized or put in boxes. Part 1 of this two-part series describes some extraverts, living and dead. Part 2 about introverts will follow.\nFamous Extraverts of the Present\nENTJ: Bill Gates\nExtraverted, Intuitive, Thinking and Judging An ENTJ personality type called the “Leader,” Bill Gates has always been decisive and strategic, willing to challenge old ideas and attract other people to his causes.

Like most ESTJs, Thatcher was direct, objective and often impersonal. She based her plans of action on logic and past experience, monitoring progress every step of the way.\nESFJ: Barbara Walters\nExtraverted, Sensing, Feeling and Judging A congenial, tactful ESFJ, Barbara Walters is an American media star. Compassion and thoroughness are her hallmarks. Called the “Caretaker,” this personality type places a high value on harmony. The cooperative nature of ESFJs make them naturals for drawing out other people while respecting their sensitivities and needs.\nESFP: Steven Spielberg\nExtraverted, Sensing, Feeling and Perceiving Steven Spielberg, famous Hollywood director, is an ESFP, a personality type called the “Performer.” Spielberg has been honored in many countries for his ground-breaking films.

They enjoy spending time together and sharing creative, stimulating conversations. Superficial topics bore them. Both have excellent intuition and can size people up accurately on short acquaintance. They share the ability to comprehend complex situations that baffle others.\nWhile the two types can become close friends, INFJs should be mindful of the ENTJ’s rough edges. This type can be blunt, with little tolerance for mistakes. Sometimes their tempers flare because they don’t recognize the effect on others. As the ENTJ’s friend you may take offense at some of his or her remarks. Refusing to engage in an argument is the most effective way to deal with this.ENTJTraits\nENTJs have a high regard for their own positions. INFJs must be the ones to establish limits in the relationship, firmly but tactfully setting their boundaries. Most ENTJs have sharp enough intuition to recognize the need for tact if they want to keep the INFJ’s friendship.\nBecause ENTJs can be so intimidating, many people hesitate to be open and honest with them. This deprives ENTJs of important information. Surprisingly, they respond best to those who stand up to them quietly but firmly. ENTJs have little regard for people they can push around. Eventually, most friends and co-workers learn that the ENTJ’s bark is worse than his or her bite.\nWhile ENTJs may seem like pillars of strength, most have a sentimental side that they try to conceal. They believe that emotional displays are a sign of weakness. When ENTJs are sad or worried, they seldom talk about it. Sensitive INFJs can usually pick up on their troubled feelings and offer compassion while not intruding with solutions.\nThe major difference between INFJs and ENTJs lies in their need to influence or control others. INFJs lack the ENTJ’s leadership drive. In a work setting this need not be a liability, because the INFJ is comfortable letting the ENTJ take charge as long as the two parties agree on objectives. INFJs don’t have the same ego investment in running the show. They like credit if it’s due, but they won’t ask for more than their share. At home, the issue of control may become troublesome. The INFJ is likely to tire of the ENTJ’s tendency to micromanage and, when things don’t go as planned, to lose his or her temper.\nFalling in Love\nENTJs are usually drawn to attractive partners. This preference is a reflection of their high standards. Most ENTJ men prefer beautiful women and most ENTJ women like handsome, confident men. To get along with an ENTJ in a relationship, an INFJ needs a well-developed sense of self. It helps to have a sense of humor.\nIf you’re an INFJ man, you may find ENTJ women intimidating. They are hard for many men to accept. In fact, women of this personality type can be quite nurturing and caring. Their femininity isn’t expressed in traditional ways. When their confrontational style surfaces, the most effective way to avoid conflict is to deflect arguments with humor and good will.\nThe partners of ENTJs will find themselves on their own much of the time. An INFJ shouldn’t expect to take top priority in the partnership. While it may seem possible at first, it won’t last. The INFJ will be expected to fit into the partner’s ambitions. Some of the INFJ’s intimacy needs will have to be met by family and friends. Otherwise, the INFJ is likely to feel emotionally short-changed.\nENTJs tend to see their partners as extensions of themselves as supportive characters in their life scripts. They expect them to honor their commitments and respect the ENTJ’s need for autonomy. Failure to do so will make the ENTJ angry.\nFamily Life\nENTJs and INFJs share a love of family life. They invest themselves fully in their children, see that they get a good education, and emphasize responsible behavior. As conscientious parents, they make sure their children do their homework and sign up for extracurricular activities.\nFriction can arise between the parents when the ENTJ parent takes charge too much. ENTJs prefer a domestic autocracy, with them at the head. An INFJ entering a long-term relationship with an ENTJ, including plans for marriage and children, should have a strong self-image and be able to set clear boundaries.\nAn ENTJ’s family can expect to have their playtime and vacations structured. The children won’t be encouraged to lie on the beach doing nothing. ENTJs don’t approve of pursuits that have no goal. In their view, leisure activities should be productive. Not only that, it’s preferable that they be scheduled. INFJ partners are likely to share this view to some extent, but they’re less intense about it.\nWork\nENTJs are career-focused and fit well into corporate life. They’re quick to solve problems and have an uncanny sense of where business decisions will lead. They aspire to leadership roles and enjoy competition.\nINFJs share the ENTJ’s gifts of highly developed intuition and creativity, but they aren’t interested in the power needed to run things. Because they find conflict unpleasant, it’s hard for them to be forceful. Also, they treasure their private time too much to participate fully in the social aspects of business.\nIn business settings, the two types complement each other. INFJs make good advisors to ENTJs. INFJs have the social sensitivity needed to help ENTJs avoid problems in the workplace that might result from heavy-handed decisions. They can express their hesitation about the wisdom of an ENTJ’s decision and have their opinions respected. By complementing the ENTJ in this way, the INFJ acts as an effective buffer.\nFamous Examples\nEleanor Roosevelt, an INFJ and the wife of U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, was a renowned humanitarian and U.S. Peace Ambassador.\nMargaret Thatcher, an ENTJ, was the first female Prime Minister of Great Britain.\n","date":"September 3, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/ac70461672343d53455b574789dd5270_hu06f8e9ea34378894774cd00cb25e89d9_47332_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/ac70461672343d53455b574789dd5270_hu06f8e9ea34378894774cd00cb25e89d9_47332_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/infj-meets-entj/","title":"INFJ meets ENTJ"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\rWhy do we love Disney characters so much?

With the help of his band, Robin Hood disguises himself as a beggar and steals Prince John’s loot to give back to the villagers. After many hair-raising adventures, he is reunited with his childhood sweetheart Maid Marian and they go off to live happily ever after.\nENTPs are extraverted (E), intuitive (N), thinking (T), and perceiving (P). Robin Hood is a true ENTP, called the “Explorer” type. ENTPs are always involved in activities that make themselves and others happy. They jump from one challenge to another, often getting more enthusiastic about thinking up new projects than finishing old ones. Their ability to see the big picture is what motivates their creativity. No matter where they are, they have ideas about how things can be improved. Sometimes they seem almost clairvoyant.\nENFP: Ariel\nENFP Ariel, Disney’s main character in “The Little Mermaid,” is a strong, determined girl who lives in an underwater kingdom. The 16-year-old mermaid spends most of her time outside the palace walls singing, daydreaming, and sharing adventures with her best friends, a guppy and a crab. She falls in love with Prince Eric, a human, but she has to suffer many trials and tribulations before her father, King Triton, transforms her into human form so she can live happily ever after with her true love.\nENFPs are extraverted (E), intuitive (N), feeling (F), and perceiving (P).

They get special pleasure from traveling to distant places. It gives them the chance to meet interesting people in other cultures. With their congenial, open personalities, they sometimes go too far with their enthusiasm and suffer through periods of confusion. They need a friend to help pull them through.\nESTP: Dodger\nESTP Dodger, from the Disney movie “Oliver and Company,” is a street-smart Jack Russell Terrier. Appointed as the leader of Fagin’s dog gang of thieves, Dodger is witty, confident, good-hearted and cool. The little dog is clever and crafty and always knows how to get out of scrapes. As Oliver’s best friend, he says he doesn’t eat cats because of “too much fur.”\nESTPs are extraverted (E), sensing (S), thinking (T), and perceiving (P). ESTPs are quick-thinking and action-oriented. As outgoing, lively, and entertaining types, they can be found wherever the action is. They’re at their best dealing with situations that call for a no-nonsense approach. They’re direct with their comments, mincing no words. They also aren’t afraid of taking risks. They’re willing to play for high stakes in the hope of reward.\nESFJ: Snow White\nThe main character in Disney’s animated movie “Snow White and the Seven Dwarves” is a beautiful young princess living with an evil stepmother. Snow White, an ESFJ, is so innocent that she can see no evil in the world. This makes her a target for her jealous stepmother, who plots to kill her with a poisoned apple. Only the kiss of a handsome prince is able to wake her from a “sleeping death.”\nESFJs are extraverted (E), sensing (S), feeling (F), and judging (J). Snow White shows the nurturing side of the ESFJ personality as she looks after the Seven Dwarves in their forest home. At their best, ESFJs are good at taking care of others and meeting their needs.\nThey are congenial, loyal and responsible, placing a high value on harmony. They need concrete priorities in their lives that are clear and practical. ESFP: Timon\nTimon is the carefree meerkat in “The Lion Kingdom.” An ESFP with a fun-loving attitude, he spends lazy days with his best friend Pumbaa. When Simba the lion cub comes along, they welcome him. Later, when Simba decides to challenge his evil Uncle Scar, Timon shows what friendship means and helps rescue Simba.

Because of their positive attitude, they’re usually well liked. They’re helpful and are generous with their resources. In fact, they’d rather give than receive. They feel self-conscious when praised too much or singled out for favorable attention. ESFPs notice everything, picking up subtleties that escape others. Downturns in luck shouldn’t be taken too seriously, they believe.\nESTJ: Woody\nIn Disney’s animated film “Toy Story,” Woody is a vintage cowboy doll, the favorite toy of a boy named Andy. An ESTJ, Woody is a determined character who tries to keep others on his side. Still, he has a lot of doubt and sadness. He hides feelings from friends so he’ll seem brave, but he’s not afraid to confront them sometimes.\nESTJs are extraverted (E), sensing (S), thinking (T), and judging (J). They are natural organizers. They’re dependable, practical and develop action plans based on logic and experience. Then they roll up their sleeves to pitch in. They keep track of progress to make sure everything is done right. ESTJs are at their best solving concrete problems. Abstract thinking is difficult for them.

Their actions are justified because, in their eyes, \u0026ldquo;the end justifies the means.\u0026rdquo;\nThey frequently believe that they are smarter and more enlightened than others, and as a result, they come to the conclusion that any input from the outside world is foolish and shallow.\nThey cease valuing human connections and instead exist in their own subjective fantasy world.\nTo achieve their objective, one must use other people. If they cause harm to others along the road, they will work to suppress any guilt they may experience. They\u0026rsquo;ll try to get away from those\nThe Good\nNelson Mandela\nBorn to the royal Thembu family in rural South Africa in 1918, Nelson Mandela spent his early boyhood tending cattle in the countryside. He grew up with two sisters in his mother’s village. At the age of seven, he was sent to a Methodist school where a teacher gave him the English name Nelson.\nAs a young man, Mandela studied law in Johannesburg. Because of his legal efforts against apartheid, he served over 27 years in prison. He was released in 1990 only after international organizations campaigned for his pardon. In 1994, he was elected South Africa’s first black leader. During his life, he received more than 250 honors, including the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize. He died in 2013 at the age of 95.\nAmong the most influential leaders of the 20th century, Mandela exhibited the best traits of the Myers-Briggs INFJ type. He was eloquent and had a sharp sense of humor that defused many touchy situations. He was confident enough to laugh at himself frequently, endearing him to followers.\nMahatma Gandhi\nBorn in 1869, Mahatma Gandhi was the spiritual and political leader of India from 1921 until 1948. Gandhi was raised in a prominent Hindu family. When he was 19, he traveled to Britain to study law. Returning home, he led a nonviolent national struggle for India’s freedom from British rule, which was finally granted in 1947. It was his greatest achievement. He became famous for his many fasts to protest social injustice.\nGandhi was a true INFJ. Even at an early age, his value system was so strong that no one could talk him out of his convictions. Although deeply committed to social change, he achieved his goals without violence. He was a visionary who infected others with his dreams.\nOctober 2, Gandhi’s birthday, is celebrated as the International Day of Nonviolence.\nMartin Luther King\nBorn in 1929, Martin Luther King was leader of the American civil rights movement in the 1950s and 60s. He used Gandhi’s nonviolent methods to combat racial injustice. King organized numerous peaceful protests U.S. cities, including the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his famous “I Have a Dream” speech.\nAs a child, King attended church regularly. His belief in the church’s mission led him to study the ministry in college. After earning a PhD degree at Boston University, he decided that church work helped him satisfy his “inner urge to serve humanity.” In 1964, King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his nonviolent protests against racial inequality.\nIn 1968, he was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee. Riots followed in many U.S. cities. After his death, King received numerous posthumous awards. In 1986, Martin Luther King Day was declared a U.S. holiday.\nMartin Luther King showed the best traits of an INFJ. He was committed to his ideals and ready to put himself in peril to defend them. He was a brilliant speaker, articulate and forceful. He was able to convince others of his beliefs and pinsire them to action.\nThe Evil\nAdolf Hitler\nBorn in 1889, Hitler was the leader of Nazi Germany from 1934 to the end of World War II. He was responsible for the deaths of at least 5.5 million Jews in Nazi concentration camps. Like many INFJs gone bad, Hitler had an unhappy childhood. He got in trouble at school, and his father beat him regularly.\nHitler’s only love was art, which his father considered a waste of time. Adolf was sent to a technical school where he performed poorly and dropped out. After his father died, he worked as a watercolor artist to make a living. His hopes for the future were dashed when he was rejected by Vienna’s Academy of Fine Arts because of his poor academic record.\nHitler had an idealistic streak typical of many INFJs. He was a vegetarian, often trying to persuade friends to give up meat in their diet by describing the inhumane slaughter of animals. He quit drinking and smoking, as well. He was kind to a select few people around him and to his dogs, which he loved. Some of Hitler’s extreme behavior has been blamed on his amphetamine addiction during the war.\nOsama bin Laden\nBorn in 1957, Osama bin Laden was the founder of al Qaeda, the terrorist organization that destroyed the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Bin Laden also claimed responsibility for other deadly attacks against civilian and military targets.\nBin Laden was raised a devout Muslim. As he was growing up, his main interest was religion, charitable work, writing poetry, and reading. In these respects, he was a model INFJ. Colleagues described him as gentle and soft spoken. However, like many INFJs, he was considered a mystery even by family members. He was known to be opinionated and severe in many situations. In the Muslim tradition, bin Laden had five wives and fathered over 20 children. Most of his wives were educated women, not subservient females as one might expect.\nBin Laden’s career as a jihadist began when he joined Muslim forces in Pakistan against the Soviets as a young man in 1979. His life ended in 2011 when he was killed in a covert military operation carried out by U.S. Special Forces and the CIA on the orders of President Barack Obama.\nDavid Koresh\nDavid Koresh was the charismatic young cult leader whose “Army of God”—the Branch Davidians— had a 51-day stand-off with the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in Waco, Texas, in 1993. The siege began after the cult stockpiled weapons to prepare for the apocalypse. The ensuing firestorm left 76 cult members and 4 federal employees dead. Koresh shot himself in the head.\nBorn to an unwed teenage mother in 1959, David Koresh was raised by his grandparents in Houston. He was a lonely child, often ridiculed by kids his own age. He did poorly in school and eventually dropped out. Finding comfort in the Bible, he memorized long passages by the time he was twelve. A high school dropout, he moved to Hollywood at the age of 20 in a failed attempt to become a rock star.\nAt 22, Koresh moved to Waco, Texas, in 1981 to join the Branch Davidians. Taking over the cult after the death of its leader, Lois Roden, he instituted “spiritual weddings,” which permitted him to have sex with female followers of all ages. As a result, he had 12 children with women other than his wife.\nWith a sense of misguided idealism, Koresh exalted his own ego at the same time as his Christian bliefs. A powerful orator, he transmitted his ideals to others, as other INFJ cult leaders have done. His Myers-Briggs traits went unchecked and eventually expressed themselves in extreme, destructive behaviors.\nDo you know the unusual pattern of signals men look for in a romantic relationship ?

A skilled and resourceful mouse, Basil never shies away from challenging situations. While typically calm and composed, he can display moments of moodiness when things don\u0026rsquo;t go as planned.\nINTJs, known for their independence and confident nature, occasionally face misunderstanding due to their straightforwardness, which they intend as encouragement for others\u0026rsquo; improvement. These natural organizers often rise to leadership positions, adept at seeing the bigger picture.\nISTJ: Li Shang Introvert, Sensing, Thinking and Judging\nCaptain Li Shang from Disney\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Mulan\u0026rdquo; epitomizes the ISTJ personality.

The MBTI is based on the work of psychiatrist Carl Jung and was developed by Katharine Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers. It categorizes individuals into 16 different personality types, each with their own unique characteristics. One of these personality types is the Introverted type, which is characterized by a focus on internal thoughts and feelings. In this article, we will explore the Introverted Myers Briggs Personality Type, some of the animals that have this type, and how you can notice it.\nWhat is the Introverted Myers Briggs Personality Type?\nThe Introverted Myers Briggs Personality Type is one of the four main categories in the MBTI, along with Extraverted, Intuitive, and Judging. Individuals with an Introverted personality type tend to be introspective, thoughtful, and reserved. They often prefer to spend time alone or in small groups, and they may find it difficult to open up to others. Introverts are often misunderstood as being shy or antisocial, but this is not necessarily the case. They simply derive their energy from within, rather than from external sources like social interactions.\nSome animals that have the Introverted Myers Briggs Personality Type\nAnimals, like humans, can also exhibit Introverted personality traits. Here are a few examples of animals that have been observed to display introverted behavior:\nNow lets have a look, what animals are shy and quiet :- Animals are more complicated than most of us realize. We can appreciate the many sides of dogs and cats that live with us, but wild creatures are a different story. Because they live in their own worlds and we aren’t close to them, we underestimate their intelligence, intuition, and altruism. We think they’re simple beings. They’re not. They’re as varied as we are.\nThis is an introduction to the introverted (I) members of the animal kingdom: the owl, sloth, deer, octopus, wolf, beaver, meerkat, and house cat. Unlike extraverted (E) animals, the introverts are generally quiet and often shy.\nINTP: Owl Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking and Perceiving\nLike most INTPs, owls have logical minds. They’re mindful and quiet. They’re solo operators and don’t socialize with other owls unless they’re mating. They don’t have patience with rules, even those laid down by other owls. While they’re not very friendly, they’re perceptive and wise.\nAs pets, owls never lose their wild behavior unless hand-raised from birth. People who use owls for falconry can tame baby owls, but only if they bond with them from the time the owlets open their eyes. Taming these birds is a challenge. An owl is an independent creature and never becomes affectionate unless it’s hungry. Owners who allow them the freedom of their houses are likely to find plants knocked over and glassware broken on the floor. They also have to deal with owl droppings on their curtains and upholstery.\nISFP: Sloth Introverted, Sensitive, Feeling and Perceiving Like human ISFPs, sloths are easygoing peace-makers. They take things as they come and live in the moment. In the company of other sloths, they are caring, mellow and considerate. While they have principles, they don’t make an issue of them. They avoid confrontations or standing up for their rights. While people think of them as lazy, what’s closer to the truth is that they’re just more laid back than humans.\nSome people keep sloths as pets. The can become quite dependent on their owners, and they’re gentle with kids. Since they move slowly, they’re no trouble to keep up with. However, they do need large living spaces and plenty of tall climbing equipment. They must be kept in a consistently warm environment to maintain their body temperature. They need special diets with just the right amount of trace ingredients, and their veterinary care is costly. Finally, owners should be prepared for the long haul, as sloths can live to be thirty.\nISFJ: Deer Introverted, Sensing, Feeling and Judging\nAs ISFJs, deer are serene creatures, but they’re alert to everything in their environment. Their acute powers of observation help them avoid danger. They make themselves scarce during hunting season, avoid predators, and are even careful to avoid cars on busy roads. With their own species, they value harmony and show respect. The few people who live with them describe them as sensitive and trustworthy.\nNot many people have been able to keep deer as pets. If not reared from their early days of life, they remain wild. Occasionally, humans have rescued fawns and raised them by hand. When this happens, deer often become loyal pets, even making friends with other animals in the house. They can be house-trained if they’re given access to the outdoors. However, an indoor life is unnatural for deer. They need plenty of space to wander in and opportunities to run with other deer.\nINTJ: Octopus Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking and Judging Does the octopus have enough personality to deserve a Myers-Briggs type? Like all INTJs, these sea creatures are independent, intelligent and creative. Octopuses are quite aware of their own sharp minds, solving difficult problems. And they’re smart enough to know when a challenge is too much for them. Unless they’re looking for a meal, they ignore other ocean life. They work alone.\nMarine biologists say that the octopus may be among the smartest ocean dwellers. Some move their arms in ways that copy the shape and movements of other sea animals. In captivity, they’ve been seen at play, much like children in a swimming pool. They grab toys in the water, then let them go in a circular current so they can catch them again. They escape from aquariums in search of food. They’ve even climbed into fishing boats and opened boxes to eat crabs. It’s unrealistic to try making a pet of an octopus.\nINFJ: Wolf Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling and Judging\nINFJ wolves, like their human counterparts, have morals and values. Often creative and inspired, they re skilled at sensing emotions in others, but they’re not likely to reveal much of themselves until complete trust has been established. Still, they are intensely concerned with the well being of their friends and families. They tend to remain mysterious and complex even when others know them well. Pack members see alpha wolves as protectors and natural leaders.\nFew people keep wolves as pets because socialization isn’t possible unless a wolf pup has been adopted within the first 2 weeks of life. For the first 4 months, the puppy needs to be kept away from other dogs in order to bond with owners. Pet wolves can become unpredictable and dangerous when they reach adulthood. These intelligent and dominant animals aren’t meant to live with humans. All wolves need 10 to 15 square miles of free space for exercise. They are running, hunting animals, always on the move.\nISTJ: Beaver Introvert, Sensing, Thinking and Judging\nLike all ISTJs, beavers are logical, hard-working types. They’re organized and live by team rules. They have a reputation for taking a practical approach to everything. When busy building and maintaining their dams, they’re dedicated workers who will do whatever is needed to get the job done. Like their human counterparts, they aren’t always easy to get along with. Both males and females get into fights on occasion, and many have scars on their rumps from being bitten by other beavers.\nBeavers don’t make good pets. They need rivers to live in. Can they be kept in a pool? Only if the owner is willing to clean out the feces (poop), because beavers defecate in water. Any furniture in the house will be reduced to wood chips. And beavers will use their skills as busy workers to rearrange pillows and other household items. Then there’s the matter of size. Many grow to be more than four feet long and weigh over 50 pounds. Even zoos find beavers hard to keep.\nINFP: Meerkat Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling and Perceiving\nINFP meerkats are loyal to their families and friends. They stick together and live according to their values. Their behavior reflects an innate idealism and desire to coexist peacefully. They are curious about everything that goes on around them and are open to new experiences. However, when any of their family is threatened, they rise to the cause and get aggressive.\nLike most INFPs, meerkats are easygoing and friendly, but they have alert minds. In the wild, they guard against danger by giving one family member the job of sentry while the others search for food. Some people, drawn by media images of these furry creatures, adopt them as pets. Usually, the work and risks are more than they bargained for. While meerkats can be cuddly, they also tend to destroy household belongings and sometimes hurt children. Their special diets and veterinary care are expensive, too.\nISTP: House Cat Introverted, Sensing, Thinking and Perceiving\nAs a typical ISTP Myers-Briggs type, the house cat is a study in contrasts. Cats are quiet and analytical, always trying to figure out how things work. But they’re easily bored. They’re keen to move on to the next adventure. As ISTPs, they’re often daredevils racing around or jumping off high places. If they were human, they’d be bungee jumpers. They’re live-and-let-live types, not particularly concerned with rules, regulations, or the good opinion of others.\nAs pets, house cats have many of the same qualities as their wild cousins, including bobcats, tigers, and leopards. The pet cat is just a lot smaller and therefore less dangerous. However, pity the mice that think it’s safe to be around one. Pet cats have the same basic instincts as jungle cats. They stalk prey, sharpen their claws, climb trees, and leap from one surface to another with grace and beauty. ISTP cats are sometimes sociable, but often they’re aloof, enjoying their private space.\nHow to notice the Introverted Myers Briggs Personality Type in animals\nIdentifying the Introverted Myers Briggs Personality Type in animals can be challenging, as they cannot communicate their thoughts and feelings verbally. However, there are certain behaviors and characteristics that may indicate an introverted personality in animals. Here are a few signs to look for:\nSolitary behavior: Animals that prefer to spend time alone or in small groups may be exhibiting introverted behavior. Independent nature: Animals that are self-sufficient and do not rely on others for support may be displaying introverted traits. Thoughtfulness: Animals that take time to think before acting or making decisions may be exhibiting introverted behavior. Reservedness: Animals that are quiet and do not engage in excessive social interactions may be displaying introverted traits. Sensitivity: Animals that are sensitive to their environment and the emotions of others may be exhibiting introverted behavior. The Introverted Myers Briggs Personality Type is a unique and often misunderstood personality trait.

Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, is no exception. To truly understand the man who became a global business magnate and political leader, we must delve into the early life and background of his parents, Frederick Christ Trump and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump. In this article, we journey back in time to explore the foundations that played a pivotal role in shaping Donald Trump\u0026rsquo;s character, ambitions, and journey to greatness.\nEarly Life of Frederick Christ Trump\nFrederick Christ Trump, commonly known as Fred Trump, was born on October 11, 1905, in Woodhaven, New York. He hailed from a family of German immigrants, and his upbringing was marked by the values of hard work, determination, and a strong entrepreneurial spirit. Fred\u0026rsquo;s father, Friedrich Trump, had ventured to the United States in search of opportunities, setting the stage for a legacy of business acumen.\nFred Trump\u0026rsquo;s Early Business Ventures\nFollowing in the footsteps of his father, Fred Trump entered the world of real estate. He started by constructing small, affordable houses in Queens and Brooklyn, catering to the working-class population. This early foray into real estate development laid the foundation for the Trump Organization, which would later become a symbol of Donald Trump\u0026rsquo;s success.\nThe Formative Years of Mary Anne MacLeod Trump\nMary Anne MacLeod Trump, born on May 10, 1912, in Tong, a small village in Scotland, was raised in a close-knit family of Scottish Gaelic heritage. She immigrated to the United States in 1930 and worked as a domestic servant before meeting Fred Trump at a party in New York City. The couple\u0026rsquo;s courtship led to their marriage in 1936.\nMary was one of a large brood of children. Her father worked as a fisherman and postman, and her family spoke Gaelic. Mary decided to emigrate to America at the age of 17 to reinvent herself as a successful American.\nWhen Mary got off the ship in New York, she had only $50 in her pockets. She was one of many Scots who had come to the U.S. to make their fortunes. An older sister, Catherine, who had already moved to the States, found Mary’s a job as a “domestic.” Mary was a nanny for a wealthy family in the New York suburbs.\nAccording to an old penpal of Mary’s and memorist, Agnes Stiven, the two girls met in Glasgow just before Mary’s trip to America. Stiven recalls that Mary’s job lasted four years. Then she had to return to Scotland because her employers lost their money during the Depression.\nIn 1934, Mary returned for a second try at success. Siven’s memoirs report that Mary was always ambitious, looking for opportunities to get ahead socially. In a photo of Mary just before she sailed from Scotland that year, she wears a glamorous winged coat and jaunty hat, and her confident stance suggests that she already had her eye on the golden ring.\nAfter arriving in New York, Mary Anne MacLeod participated in the city’s social scene as much as possible. Soon she met Frederick Trump at an elite dance. Trump was then building his fortune as a real estate developer. When Mary met him, he was considered one of the city’s most eligible bachelors. They married in 1936. Over the next few years, they had five children, of which Donald was the second.\nDespite the fact that the Trump family lived a life of showy opulence, Fred did not give things to his children without conditions. When Donald’s behavior got too bad or his grades poor, his father deprived him of material things. Intimacy seems to have played little role in their relationship—or in any of the family relationships. Only his older brother, Fred, Jr., seemed to be a free spirit. (He died of alcoholism at age 42.)\nMary never worked outside the home during their marriage. She was in most respects a traditional housewife. However, she devoted large amounts of time to social activities and charitable works. Mrs. Trump frequently appeared on New York City’s streets in opulent furs and jewelry—unlike the teenage girl who sailed to America in 1929. From the time her hair began to grey, she styled it in a blonde pompadour similar to her son’s trademark hairdo today. Mary finally became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1940.\nFrom the age of five, Donald was getting into scrapes. He was belligerent in school, bullied other children, and challenged grown-ups. In the family’s prosperous Queens neighborhood, he developed the reputation of being an incorrigible child. He was the image of his father in many ways. After a series of Donald’s pranks when the boy was 13, Fred Trump abruptly sent him to a strict military school. His mother appears to have had no voice in the decision. The abandonment was hard for Donald, but eventually he relished the harsh school environment and the opportunities to bully other cadets.\nAlthough personal information about the family is scant, Mary appears to have had much less influence on Donald’s development than his father. Fred Trump ruled the roost.\nMary MacLeod Trump died in 2000 at the age of 88, just a year after her husband passed away. Today, her remains are buried in New Hyde Park, New York, along with those of her deceased husband, Fred, and their first-born son, Fred Trump, Jr.\nParenting and Family Values\nFred and Mary Anne Trump\u0026rsquo;s parenting style was characterized by their immigrant backgrounds and the values they held dear.\nThey instilled in their children a sense of discipline, responsibility, and resilience. These values, shaped by their own struggles and successes, would later influence Donald Trump\u0026#39;s approach to business and leadership. Tracing Roots and Traditions: The Ancestral Heritage That Shaped Donald Trump\u0026rsquo;s Parents The tapestry of an individual\u0026rsquo;s heritage often weaves together threads of culture, history, and tradition, shaping their values and beliefs in profound ways.

In this article, we journey through time and across continents to explore the notable historical and cultural connections that left an indelible mark on the Trump family\u0026rsquo;s values and beliefs.\nGerman Roots and the Trump Family Legacy\nFred Trump\u0026rsquo;s ancestry can be traced back to Kallstadt, a picturesque village in southwestern Germany. His grandfather, Christian Johannes Trump, left Kallstadt in 1885 for the United States in pursuit of the American Dream. The values of hard work, determination, and entrepreneurship that Christian carried with him across the Atlantic would continue to reverberate through the generations. The Trump family\u0026rsquo;s German heritage is reflected in their commitment to building businesses, their reputation for hard work, and their strong familial bonds—a characteristic of many German households.\nScottish Tradition and MacLeod Heritage\nMary Anne MacLeod Trump\u0026rsquo;s heritage hails from the rugged landscapes of Scotland. Born and raised in Tong, a village on the Isle of Lewis, she grew up in a Gaelic-speaking family steeped in the island\u0026rsquo;s rich cultural traditions. The Scottish emphasis on community, resilience, and self-sufficiency would find its way into her life even after she crossed the ocean to the United States. Mary Anne\u0026rsquo;s MacLeod heritage reflects her strong sense of family loyalty and her ability to adapt to new environments while preserving her roots.\nCultural and Historical Influences\nThe cultural and historical contexts of Germany and Scotland during the times when Frederick and Mary Anne\u0026rsquo;s ancestors lived had a lasting impact on their values and perspectives. In Germany, the late 19th and early 20th centuries marked periods of economic growth, industrialization, and social change. These factors likely influenced the entrepreneurial spirit and value placed on hard work that would be passed down to Fred Trump.\nIn Scotland, the Isle of Lewis and its surrounding areas were known for their deep-rooted traditions, especially in industries like fishing and weaving. The MacLeod family\u0026rsquo;s connection to these industries could have contributed to Mary Anne\u0026rsquo;s pragmatic outlook and her ability to navigate new challenges with resilience.\nShared Values and the Trump Legacy\nDespite coming from different cultural backgrounds, Fred and Mary Anne Trump\u0026rsquo;s ancestral heritages shared common values such as hard work, family bonds, and determination. These values became intertwined with their personal experiences, and they would go on to impart them to their children, including Donald Trump.\nThe Trump Influence: How Frederick and Mary Anne Trump Shaped Donald\u0026rsquo;s Path to Success The journey to success is often shaped by the values and lessons learned during one\u0026rsquo;s formative years.

In this article, we explore the ways in which his parents\u0026rsquo; upbringing and values left an indelible mark on Donald Trump\u0026rsquo;s life, illustrating specific examples of how their traits are interwoven into his journey.\nA Legacy of Entrepreneurship and Hard Work\nFred Trump\u0026rsquo;s early life was marked by his father\u0026rsquo;s real estate ventures, which laid the groundwork for a legacy of entrepreneurship and business acumen. The values of hard work, discipline, and seizing opportunities were passed down to Donald. These traits can be seen in his early real estate ventures, such as the development of the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York City. Just as his father built affordable housing, Donald expanded his business empire by targeting luxury properties and high-end resorts, demonstrating his understanding of the importance of diversification.\nEmphasis on Self-Promotion and Marketing\nMary Anne MacLeod Trump\u0026rsquo;s Scottish heritage brought with it a sense of self-reliance and the ability to navigate new environments. This influence is evident in Donald Trump\u0026rsquo;s affinity for self-promotion and branding. Mary Anne\u0026rsquo;s knack for preserving her identity while adapting to new circumstances is mirrored in Donald\u0026rsquo;s ability to craft a distinct public image that resonated with his audience.\nAttention to Detail and Quality\nFred Trump\u0026rsquo;s meticulous attention to detail in real estate development translated into a focus on quality and luxury in Donald\u0026rsquo;s ventures. The Trump brand became synonymous with opulence and luxury, drawing upon his father\u0026rsquo;s emphasis on delivering a product that exceeded expectations. This attention to detail can be observed in projects such as Trump Tower, where architectural excellence and aesthetic appeal were paramount.\nRisk-Taking and Resilience\nBoth of Donald Trump\u0026rsquo;s parents faced challenges that required resilience and risk-taking. Fred navigated economic downturns and regulatory hurdles, showcasing his ability to adapt and persevere. Similarly, Mary Anne\u0026rsquo;s journey from a Scottish village to the United States demanded resilience and a willingness to embrace change.

Despite attending college briefly at Fordham University, he soon returned to New York to work alongside his father. Fred\u0026rsquo;s achievements include the development of affordable housing units across New York City, a feat that addressed the post-war housing shortage and contributed to his financial success.\nChallenges and Resilience\nFred\u0026rsquo;s career faced challenges as well. He navigated through the Great Depression and the economic turmoil of the 1970s, showcasing his ability to adapt to changing circumstances. These challenges likely influenced his emphasis on financial stability and the importance of navigating economic uncertainties—a lesson that would be passed down to his son, Donald.\nMary Anne MacLeod Trump: From Scotland to New York\nMary Anne MacLeod\u0026rsquo;s education was limited due to circumstances in her Scottish village. However, her life experiences were enriched by working as a domestic servant in Scotland before immigrating to the United States. Her tenacity and determination to start anew in a foreign land are indicative of her strong-willed nature.\nAdapting to a New Culture\nMary Anne\u0026rsquo;s transition from Scotland to the United States exposed her to different cultural norms and challenges.

Mary Anne MacLeod Trump"},{"categories":["INFJ","Myers-Briggs Personality Types","Your Secret Self"],"contents":"It’s fair to say that any two people with this combination of Myers-Briggs traits are likely to have adjustment problems if they’re to function smoothly together. While they are joined in their preference for privacy (introversion), this isn’t enough to make them compatible. Both have a preference for judging, as well, but they use the function in dissimilar ways due to their other trait differences.\nThe INFJ is introverted (I), intuitive (N), feeling (F), and judging (J). The ISTJ shares the introverted, judging traits, but is a sensing (S) and (T) thinking type. How do INFJs and ISTJs get along and where do they run into trouble? Friendship\nISTJs are one of the most responsible of the sixteen Myers-Briggs types, but they can be inflexible. Although INFJs are responsible, too, their drive to meet obligations is softened by concern about the impact of their decisions on others.\nISTJs focus on objective details. They are bound by rules and regulations. INFJs are more comfortable with complex, subtle intellectual considerations. This difference can put them at odds. The ISTJ may view the INFJs as freethinkers, oblivious of convention. INFJs may consider ISTJs to be narrow-minded and rigid.\nAnother difference in their personalities relates to the way they gather information before making decisions. ISTJs rely on concrete details. They miss nothing and take nothing for granted. INFJs are more imaginative. They’re willing to trust their hunches as the basis for action. They feel that this is justified by the fact that their intuition is so reliable. As friends, INFJs and ISTJs can get impatient with each other because they think so differently.\nINFJs are impatient with themselves, but tolerate the idiosyncrasies of others, at least openly. ISTJs, being quite sure of everything they think and do, can be demanding companions. INFJs sometimes find this hard to deal with.\nRomance\nWhile ISTJs make loyal partners, they are seldom outwardly sentimental, rarely putting their feelings into words. To them, the fact of their commitment is enough. This can be frustrating to INFJ partners, who like to hear words of affection. Without verbal evidence of a partner’s loyalty, INFJs can feel ignored or unappreciated.\nBecause ISTJs are traditionalists at heart, they usually conform to stereotypes of their gender. Females engage in conventional female activities, such as cooking and decorating, while males are more “macho”—preferring to watch football or tinker with their cars. They are protective of their female partners, figuring that it’s expected of them. They know how to make the masculine moves that the culture approves of—opening doors, pulling out chairs, and so on.\nFamily Life\nISTJs are happy to undertake routine responsibilities in the home—mowing the lawn, cleaning the kitchen, getting the children to school on time, and so on. On the other hand, INFJs seldom enjoy activities that involve regularity or what they define as drudgery. They prefer creative tasks, such as decorating rooms in the house or planning dinner menus. While the differences between the types can be complementary, they may cause friction when the two types are collaborating on the same task. When painting a room, for example, the ISTJ is likely to prefer a light, neutral color such as eggshell, while the INFJ may want to experiment with maroon. Neither can understand the other’s choice.\nBecause ISTJs love tradition, they go all out to celebrate important family events. Everyone is expected to show up and participate. Absentees are likely to have a guilt trip laid on them. INFJs find the ISTJ’s enthusiasm for get-togethers hard to understand. Being intuitive types, they aren’t conventional and don’t see the point, especially if they’re not fond of some of the people involved.\nWhile both types enjoy their home life, ISTJs are neater and tidier. They prefer subdued, tasteful decor. Things are put away. The yard is neat and orderly, with no extravagant landscaping. Here they part company with INFJs, who are chronically untidy—although they do clean up after themselves when prompted. INFJ tastes in decorating are more elaborate and inventive. They’re so caught up in creative projects that messes are inevitable. Pleasure takes priority over neatness.\nWhen children are involved, ISTJs enforce the regulations they learned while growing up. Family roles are clear. Fathers and mothers make the rules and children follow them. INFJs are not bound by tradition. They make up things as they go along. This free-wheeling attitude can be frustrating for ISTJs.\nSecrets of Success\nThe INFJ, being capable of more insight than the ISTJ, may need to make the greatest adjustment in the relationship. However, when major conflicts arise, it’s important for the INFJ to explain to the ISTJ in concrete terms what he or she needs and why. Abstract reasoning frustrates most ISTJs.\nWhen handled patiently and given down-to-earth reasons for requests, ISTJs who were once difficult partners may become more spontaneous and tolerant.

When the data were analyzed at the end of the 14 years, researchers found that people of various Myers-Briggs categories most often held the following jobs listed below.\nCareer Distribution by Myers-Briggs Type\nISTJ: Administrators in schools, industry, and health care, dentists, police and detectives,auditors and accountants\rISFJ: Nurses, clerical supervisors, preschool teachers, librarians, health technicians\rINFJ: Education consultants, clergy, physicians, media specialists, teachers (English, art, drama)\rINTJ: Lawyers, scientists, computer systems analysts, chemical engineers, university teachers\rISTP: Farmers, mechanics and repairers, electrical technicians, engineers, dental hygienists\rISFP: Storekeepers and stock clerks, nurses, dental assistants, bookkeepers, mechanics and repairers\rINFP: Psychiatrists and psychologists, writers, artists, and editors, teachers, social workers, musicians and composers\rINTP: Writers, artists and entertainers, computer programmers, social scientists\rESTP: Marketing personnel, police and detectives, managers and administrators, retail salespeople, auditors\rESFP: child care workers, receptionists, salespeople, religious workers, teachers (preschool)\rENFP: Rehabilitation counselors, teachers (art and drama), writers, artists, entertainers, psychologists, clergy\rENTP: Photographers, marketing personnel, salespeople, journalists, computer systems analysts\rESTJ: Teachers, school administrators, surgeons, factory and site supervisors, lawyers\rESFJ: Medical secretaries, clergy, nurses, home economists, hairdressers and cosmetologists\rENFJ: Clergy, teachers, actors and entertainers, writers and artists, consultants\rENTJ: Lawyers, managers, mortgage brokers, administrators (computer systems and education), scientists\rThe study data do not indicate which careers are best for certain types. The information simply reflects what jobs people were holding at the time the study was in progress. It serves mainly to provide helpful information about the demands of each career.\nWhen evaluating potential careers, it’s best to consider how your preferences relate to the demands of certain professions. Every career uses some of each of the eight preferences. Public contact vs working alone: Introversion/Extraversion\nJobs that involve mainly working with others are better for Extraverts, especially if they involve selling, persuading, and motivating. While Introverts are often capable of doing these things, too, they may find themselves drained by the constant interaction with others.\nHands-on activity vs. abstract speculation: Sensing/Intuition\nA hands-on profession appealing to Sensing types is one where “doing” and “bottom line” are the main goals, as in accounting, trial law, and civil engineering. Jobs with short-term, measurable objectives are more attractive to them. In contrast, jobs that require foresight and planning are better suited to Intuitives. Examples are architectural engineering, teaching law (professors), and financial planning.\nObjective vs. people-oriented decisions: (Thinking/Feeling)\nThinking jobs are attractive to those concerned mainly with logic and objectivity. They don’t want to be embroiled in personal relationships or human welfare decisions. Careers in the Thinking category include stockbrokers, high-tech research, and military positions. Feelers are attracted to careers involving interpersonal dynamics, such as the clergy, counselors, teachers, and nurses, among others.\nStructured demands vs. flexible innovation: (Judging/Perceiving)\nJudging types do best in careers that require scheduling and established procedures—everything from bus driving to orthopedic surgery. Jobs that are more open-ended, requiring flexibility and ability to adjust, include journalism, strategic planning and entrepreneurial endeavors.\nIt’s a Personal Decision\nWhen you consider your own type, such as ISFP, the key is not to choose a career that theoretically belongs on a list, but rather to consider the various facets of your type and how they relate to the job possibilities. A bus driver who travels a short downtown route every day is different from a bus driver transporting senior citizens through the city and acting as their tour guide.\nThe goal is to find a career that fits your preferences rather than force yourself into a job that theoretically suits your type. The better the personal fit, the less job stress and the more satisfaction you’ll experience in the long run. If you have an opportunity to practice law you might find that the job in question involves representing low-income clients, about whom you feel personal concern. if you’re an INFP you may be tempted to rule out the possibility because the career is not on the master list. Yet the job may be a perfect fit for your type, with its tendency toward compassion and flexibility.\n","date":"August 2, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/06efc97d6b2c3e6adf49ab240b33acfb_hu60d12b3ce4778627ff8d0c18f02d339e_103974_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/06efc97d6b2c3e6adf49ab240b33acfb_hu60d12b3ce4778627ff8d0c18f02d339e_103974_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/myers-briggs-type-and-career-choice/","title":"Career Distribution by Myers-Briggs Type"},{"categories":["INFJ","Myers-Briggs Personality Types","Your Secret Self"],"contents":"The Myers-Briggs types INFJ and INFP are affected by depression more than most other types. Both are Introverted (I), intuitive (N), and feeling (F). This means that they have a compassionate nature, see the underlying meaning of events around them and have trouble shielding themselves from the pain of others, particularly in the face of indifference of others. They puzzle about why they are so powerless to change things. They realize that they were meant for greater things. Feeling that they have little impact on the world or situations around them can trigger depression.\nBoth types tend to be misunderstood, partly because they are so rare—together comprising less than 3 percent of the overall population.\nDepression in INFJs\nINFJs can assuage their guilt with the knowledge that they are doing the best they can, realizing that most of us have less power in the world than we think. It’s acceptable and necessary for them to take time for themselves to replenish their energy. Instead of chastising themselves for their impotence, they should realize that even a small difference means a lot. As Eleanor Roosevelt once said, “It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness.”\n* INFJs experience loneliness much of time. It’s hard for most people to read the feelings of INFJs because they are highly sensitive, quiet, and self-contained. For this reason, few people really understand them. Reasons for Depression\nEven when questioned about their feelings, they keep most issues to themselves. They feel sure that others won’t understand their pain or their subtle feelings.\nThe relationships of INFJs tend to be one-sided. INFJs care for people and their problems, and people tend to abuse this fact. They take advantage of the kindness of INFJs. The INFJ gets nothing but the satisfaction of helping another. It can be a lonely situation.\nPeople close to INFJs can fail to give supportive feedback because they get confused by the INFJ’s conflicting tendencies. On the one hand, this Myers-Briggs type gets satisfaction from being around them. On the other, sometimes INFJs tire of meeting the emotional needs of others and want only to be alone. This causes confusion among people close to the INFJ. It often confuses INFJs themselves, leading to feelings of depression.\nThe idealism of INFJs can lead them down dark paths. They have a tendency to place high expectations on others just as they do on themselves. The real world can be corrupt in many ways, a fact that many INFJs overlook until it’s too late. The high moral standards of INFJs may put them at odds with others, leaving a breach in understanding.\nDepression in INFPs\nINFPs, much like INFJs, are prone to depression because of their naturally sensitive nature. This quality makes them wonderful people but causes them to experience things on a deep level. Sometimes their depression is caused by the feeling that others don’t understand them. It’s true that INFPs are very different from the norm and don’t fit into shallow stereotypes. Their feelings of apartness can make them feel alienated and misunderstood as they search for someone who will empathize with them and help them heal themselves.\nReasons for Depression\nINFPs are idealists, holding unrealistic expectations of others. This is especially true of their love relationships. No human could live up to the expectations they’ve erected in their own minds. When a relationship falls apart, they are devastated, triggering a cascade of other emotional problems.\nTheir naiveté makes them an easy target for toxic individuals. Because their own intentions and morals are above reproach, they think that’s true of all other people. Even when the actions of others show hostile intent, INFPs tend to discount their suspicions because it’s so far from anything they would do.\n* They can’t imagine that anyone would hurt them intentionally. It takes many years of living to discover the bitter truth—that many unfriendly acts are done on purpose. Their highly developed empathy makes them emotional sponges. They pick up easily the energy of others, making themselves susceptible to the moods of those around them. They’re infected by friends’ tribulations. For this reason, they find it hard to say “no,” and people often take advantage of them.\nINFPs think too much. Because they stay isolated in their internal world much of the time, they overthink everything that happens to them. When they don’t come up with satisfying answers, they go back to the drawing board and think some more.\nIn some ways, INFPs are a study in conflict. They’re perfectionists about some things and disorganized about others. Administrative tasks are too boring to keep them engaged, and so their records become chaotic—causing problems later. There are many more interesting things to do than paperwork. With so many items on their agendas and so little time, they’re reluctant to focus on menial tasks.\nBeing sensitive, they get upset easily. In stressful situations, they tend to avoid the sources until the problem gets too big to manage. Procrastination adds to their stress and damages their self-esteem. When criticized for this or any other deficiency, they put the most negative spin on others’ evaluations and take them personally. It’s difficult to give INFPs any feedback that they construe as totally positive.\nINFPs need close friends who are both supportive and nonjudgmental—people who can coax them out of their dark moods and enjoy the sunny side of life again.\nSimilarities Between INFJs and INFPs\nWhether INFJs and INFPs get overwhelmed by personal conflicts or global injustices, they switch to hermit mode. They want to make a change, but the prospect seems hopeless. Therefore, their backup strategy is isolation. And this eventually leads to depression. Both types need to feel supported and appreciated when they are depressed. Just knowing that the people around them value them and do not judge them can be of immense help.\n","date":"August 2, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/52917f94c6efe986905ff63b50858e0c_hua6d89fe47872dbd5c6b38b3d66d32d51_76819_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/52917f94c6efe986905ff63b50858e0c_hua6d89fe47872dbd5c6b38b3d66d32d51_76819_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/depression-profiles-infj-vs-infp/","title":"Depression Profiles—INFJ vs. INFP"},{"categories":["INFJ","ISFJ","Myers-Briggs Personality Types","Your Secret Self"],"contents":"The Myers-Briggs personality test has been used to analyze many famous people. While most celebrities, past and present, have never taken a personality test, psychologists who are knowledgeable about typology believe they know what the outcomes would be.\nIntroverts are usually deep thinkers, complex individuals who can be charming in public but are private in their personal lives. Introverts aren’t easily categorized or put in boxes. Most politicians, entertainers, and leaders of large organizations are extraverts. Part 1 of this two-part series described some famous extraverts, living and dead. This article, Part 2, is about famous introverts.\nFamous Introverts of the Past\nISFJ: Mother Teresa Introverted, Sensing, Feeling and Judging 03-motherteresaMother Teresa was an ISFJ, a type called the “Protector.” True to her personality type, she was caring, down-to-earth and dependable. Working in the slums of Calcutta, India, she founded a charity that ran homes for the dying. Like most ISFJs, she was compassionate and dedicated to helping others.\nINTJ: Bobby Fischer Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking and Judging 06-bobby-fischerBobby Fischer, world chess champion. was an INTJ—a Myers-Briggs personality type called the “Mastermind.” He was a brilliant and creative strategist, but a difficult man.\nLike many INTJs, he sometimes seemed so confident of himself as to appear overbearing. True to his type, he liked to design models based on theories he’d developed. INFJ: Mahatma Ghandi Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling and Judging The foremost advocate of nonviolent civil disobedience in the world, Gandhi was an INFJ who led India to independence in 1947. It was Ghandi who inspired American civil rights advocates struggling for racial equality in the 1960s. Like most INFJs, Ghandi was idealistic, determined and compassionate. His integrity was evident in everything he did.\nINTP: Marie Curie Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking and Perceiving 11-mariecurieThe INTP “Problem-Solver” personality type, Marie Curie discovered radium in 1898. True to type, she was quiet and modest. Exacting in her work, she was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize. Like most INTPs, she adopted an approach to life and work that was intellectual and independent. She was intensely private.\nINFP: Princess Diana Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling and Perceiving 12-princessdianaPrincess Diana, beloved by millions, was an INFP noted for her compassion and global philanthropy. INFPs are soft-spoken idealists who dedicate themselves to helping others.\nThey avoid conflict and try not to create waves, but when they see people behaving unkindly, they can become surprisingly assertive. ISFP: David Bowie Introverted, Sensing, Feeling and Perceiving 13-davidbowieDavid Bowie was an ISFP, a personality type called the “Artist.” He was a world-famous singer, songwriter and actor with a reputation as a flamboyant celebrity onstage. In private, Bowie was like most ISFPs—a gentle, modest human being. He had a natural curiosity that fueled his creative spirit.\nFamous Introverts of the Present\nISTP: Dalai Lama Introverted, Sensing, Thinking and Perceiving 14-dalailamaAn ISTP, the Dalai Lama is a famous Buddhist leader. True to his personality type, he is practical, reserved, and expresses himself in deeds. He is an independent man with an analytical mind. His enterprising, adventurous spirit were evident in his flight to India after the Chinese invaded his homeland, Tibet.\nISTJ: Angela Merkel Introverted, Sensing, Thinking and Judging Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany, is an ISTJ. As a political leader, she is organized, objective and demanding. While ISTJs know how to be gracious and articulate in social situations, at heart they are independent, private types. They don’t make decisions without first collecting detailed information.\n","date":"August 2, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/eedaa9759852472a1c311364515d5048_hu64fa90e20f234ef8bb70b950d2c330a0_40424_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/eedaa9759852472a1c311364515d5048_hu64fa90e20f234ef8bb70b950d2c330a0_40424_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/famous-people-and-their-myers-briggs-personality-types-part-2-the-introverts/","title":"Famous People and Their Myers-Briggs Personality Types: Part 2, the Introverts"},{"categories":["INFJ","ISFJ","Myers-Briggs Personality Types","Your Secret Self"],"contents":"When an INFJ and ESFJ are drawn to each other, the attraction becomes obvious fairly quickly— although the ESFJ is usually the more transparent of the two and is likely to make the first overtures. INFJs are generally cautious until they’re sure of a relationship.\nESFJs are generous and outgoing, giving without any thought of return. If someone expresses a need, they’re among the first to try to satisfy it. They place a high value on harmony. They’re at their best organizing people for family, community or work events. INFJs are generous, too, but they’re reserved and shrink from being in the public eye.\nAs traditionalists, ESFJs rely on tried-and-true methods of solving problems.\nFor this reason, they can overlook newer, better approaches that are obvious to others—a habit that may prove annoying for inventive friends and relatives who are reluctant to endanger their relationship with the ESFJ by being critical. This is especially true of INFJs, who usually have innovative ideas but are too tactful to hurt the feelings of less adventurous folks.\nFriendship\nESTJs are steadfast friends. They will disrupt their work schedules to accommodate others. If a friend’s car is in the shop, the ESFJ doesn’t hesitate to provide transportation. But when the ESFJ is in the same boat a month later and a friend isn’t willing to reciprocate, hurt feelings are likely to result. Underneath it all, ESFJs need evidence that others care about them, too.\nSometimes ESFJs go to lengths that aren’t healthy in order to make others happy. Being warm and sympathetic is a top priority. If INFJ and ESFJ friends go to a restaurant that serves delicious French pastries, the overweight INFJ might say, “I can have the entrée, but don’t let me have any dessert!” When they’ve finished the main dish, the server comes around with a tray of petit fours. The ESFJ sees the look of longing in the friend’s eyes, knowing that the friend will regret the indulgence later on. What does the ESFJ say? “Go ahead. One dessert can’t hurt you.”\nRomance\nESFJ partners are drawn to the rich imaginations and agile minds of INFJs. Falling in love is a totally absorbing experience. If an INFJ encourages the relationship, ESFJs show their affection with gifts, notes, and other symbols of commitment. Even when doing extra favors is inconvenient or expensive, ESFJs go out of their way to satisfy a partner’s desires. Some ESFJs may be more in love with love than with their partners per se.\nUnfortunately, ESFJs are not always aware that a relationship is starting to fail. Their outgoing, optimistic natures may lead them to believe that everything is fine. In the meantime, the INFJ may continue a partnership that’s going downhill without airing his or her dissatisfaction. If the truth be known, the INFJ may not want to risk losing the intimacy with the ESFJ without another prospect standing in the wings.\nThis can be devastating for ESFJs who didn’t see the signs. They tend to deal with these crises by looking for their own mistakes and shortcomings. They think about the times when they were less generous or thoughtful than they might have been, even though this assessment may be baseless. They suffer a period of lowered self-esteem.\nFamily\nIn their efforts to keep family life harmonious, both INFJs and ESTJs often sweep problems under the rug rather than air them and resolve the conflict. Partners who swallow their irritation and/or underestimate their own needs tend to wear themselves out or become resentful. They need to risk the good will of others by saying “no” sometimes.\nWhile ESFJs are easygoing and warm at home, they usually have set ideas about social matters—unlike unconventional INFJs. Their expectations are tied to tradition. Often they’re the ones in charge of family get-togethers such as Thanksgiving dinner. Also, they generally take responsibility for buying birthday, anniversary, and holiday gifts.\nINFJs don’t understand all the fuss about family celebrations. They’ll go along to keep the peace, but they don’t want to be drawn into a lot of complicated arrangements. They can’t fathom why anyone would like to collect so many people around them over the holidays. INFJs prefer intimate gatherings with just the immediate family present.\nESFJs are involved in school and community activities more than their reserved INFJ partners. They plan educational or character-building social activities for their children, such as after-school sports. The children may accompany them to events at retirement communities or volunteer at animal shelters. INFJs are less group-oriented and have more reserved ways of demonstrating their ideals and desire to help others.\nSecrets of Success\nWhen an INFJ and ESFJ stay together and adjust to each other’s styles, they often find that each benefits from the influence of the other. ESFJs help INFJs expand their social horizons and avoid becoming isolated.\nWith their warm personalities, ESFJs attract a circle of friends that can prove stimulating to the INFJ. INFJs can bring more warmth and intimacy to the relationship by initiating activities they share as a twosome, often strengthening their bond.

Is there an instant attraction? Do they repel each other like two magnets?\nLooking at their personality traits, you’d think they have little in common. When an early attraction persists, it’s cause for wonder. Usually, the bond is associated with their shared feeling (F) trait.\nIntroversion (I) vs. Extraversion (E)\nThe first big difference lies in the INFJ’s need for privacy vs. the ESFP’s preference for social contact. On the introversion/extraversion (I/E) scale, the inwardly focused nature of INFJs causes them to be reserved and, in extreme cases, reclusive. They dislike crowds and need considerable time alone. They’re worn out by prolonged social interaction. In contrast, extraverts are social butterflies. The company of other people energizes them. Being left alone too long makes them feel anxious and disorganized.\nWhen an INFJ and ESFP are getting ready to go to a party, the INFJ may say, “Do we really have to go? I’d rather stay home and watch the Ferris Bueller movie again.” The ESFP is likely to reply, “C’mon, the party will be fun. We’ll see old friends. ”\nIf you’re bored we can leave early. To which the INFJ responds, “I can promise you, I’ll want to leave early. And I know you. You won’t.” And so it’s likely to go. Intuition (N) vs. Sensing (S)\nThe difference in Myers-Briggs traits can be more divisive for the partners in terms of their intuitive (N) vs. sensing traits. The well-developed intuition (N) of INFJs gives them a talent for interpreting the meaning of events around them on limited evidence. Their hunches are usually well-founded. To the sensing (S) ESFP, this makes no sense. ESFPs draw conclusions based on what they see and hear in the immediate environment. They’re less concerned about the meaning behind people’s actions than they are with the actions themselves.\nOn the way home from the party mentioned above, the ESFP may say, “Wow, did you see the ring on Jill’s finger? I guess they’re getting married after all.” To which the INFJ may respond, “I don’t know, they looked pretty tense with each other. I wouldn’t count on it.”\nThe ESFP thinks, “What? A ring is a ring! We all know what that means.” The INFJ thinks, “Ring? Who cares about the ring? I can tell there’s trouble in that relationship.” Mostly likely, the INFJ is right.\nPerceiving (P) vs Judging (J)\nINFJs and ESFPs are also worlds apart on their perceiving (P) and judging (J) traits, especially if they tend to be at extreme ends of the scales.\nPerceiving ESFPs are easy-going and fun-loving. If they’re a little late for an appointment or miss it entirely, oh well. Manaña is the name of the game. Not for the INFJ. To be late is almost a sin. When frustrations arise in a relationship, they’re often due to P/J differences in the decision-making styles of the two types. ESFPs like to delay decisions until the last possible moment. In their view, there’s always more information to be gathered. They’re less concerned about bringing decisions to a close than enjoying the ride. INFJs prefer closure. They want to sign the contract and whip out their credit card. They’re more interested in reaching their destination than enjoying the scenery along the way. In old Type A—Type B terms, the INFJ is a Type A and the ESFP is a Type B.\nWhen an INFJ/ESFP couple decide to buy a refrigerator, the INFJ goes to the computer, looks up comparative data and prices, and consults Consumer Reports for recommendations. By the time the partners walk out the door the next day to shop, the INFJ has already decided on a refrigerator, including the make and model.\nNot so fast, says the partner. We’d better look around. They visit every appliance store in town before sundown, and still the ESFP hasn’t made a decision. They’d better go back on Sunday, the ESFP says. The INFJ is going crazy. Before they left the house that morning, the INFJ knew which refrigerator they should buy. He or she would like to wring the partner’s neck.\nFeeling (F) vs. Thinking (T)\nVive la feeling! At least the two types have this preference in common. Both are concerned with the other’s emotional comfort. They’re careful of the impact of their words, actions, and decisions upon the other. Both are kind, compassionate people.\nTheir feeling trait helps them work through the incompatible aspects of their personalities. The ESFP member of the couple is optimistic, playful and fun-loving. Of the two refrigerator shoppers, he or she takes the most outgoing, enthusiastic view of life. The INFJ is more focused and driven. Because they love each other, they make allowances and put effort into getting along and enjoying each other’s company. They give each other wiggle room.\nThe balance is important. If the INFJ is too demanding and insists that the partner make a choice by noon on Saturday based on Consumer Reports data, the person may pay later. The first time the refrigerator makes a funny noise, the ESFP will say, “See? I told you we should look around more.”\nThe secret of a successful INFJ/ESFP relationship lies in the couple’s tolerance, compassion and mutual enjoyment of life together. Their feeling function—their love for each other—is a major factor in the growth and stability of the partnership.\n","date":"August 2, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/85014c534440ec2d840f625d8426cf47_hu4594fe17d5391c63d2586482ad9b31ca_102527_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/85014c534440ec2d840f625d8426cf47_hu4594fe17d5391c63d2586482ad9b31ca_102527_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/infj-meets-esfp/","title":"INFJ Meets ESFP"},{"categories":["INFJ","ISFJ","Myers-Briggs Personality Types","Your Secret Self"],"contents":"All things considered, the attraction between the ESTJs and INFJs isn’t surprising. Because ESTJs are conventional people, they prefer colorful partners to make their lives more interesting. They aren’t drawn to other ESTJs. INFJs have creative minds and supply the friendly, playful traits ESTJs are missing. The INFJ, in turn, is rewarded by an appreciative audience.\nAn INFJ may find ESTJ friends too direct and outspoken. They tend to overlook polite ways of dealing with others. Often, they forget to say “please” and “thank you.” To build a good relationship with an ESTJ, it’s best to let the person know up front that these courtesies are important to you.\nYou’ll avoid frustration in friendships with ESTJs if you make an effort to understand how their minds work. They aren’t like you—a person who would rather act on hunches than gather detailed information.\nESTJs are guided mainly by rules, principles, and traditional values. INFJs adopt novel approaches to problems and bypass convention. INFJs are rare enough (one percent of the population) that most ENFJs (over ten percent) haven’t met enough of them to understand them. Type Differences Getting To Know an ESTJ Don’t expect much spontaneity from a new ESTJ friend. For them, work and play are kept separate. Activities are scheduled, and work comes first. Play must be earned. Even then, it should have a goal, such as walking to lose weight or attending concerts for cultural improvement. Since INFJs need a purpose in their leisure activities, too, you’ll have this in common.\nYou’ll find that ESTJ friends are quick to take charge and give advice, whether it’s asked for or not. When something goes wrong, the first thing the ESTJ wants to know is what happened, why, and who caused the problem. Only then is he or she ready to think about a solution. As a result, the INFJ may find this type judgmental and hard. The compassionate INFJ’s position is that mistakes are part of the game and it’s best to move on to a remedy.\nESTJs generally expect to share expenses on outings. They’re not comfortable letting others pay their way. The exception is when the ESTJ is a female. She’ll allow a date to buy dinner or pay for a movie because it’s the conventional thing to do. Her way of reciprocating may be to buy a new dress that pleases her companion. ESTJ men often give candy and flowers. They remember birthdays with cards or gifts. These actions serve to replace the flowery expressions of love they have a hard time expressing.\nWorking with ESTJs\nESTJs function best with structure. They want to know what’s required of them and what the deadlines are. Unlike INFJs, they don’t improvise easily. Because ESTJs are so focused on the concrete aspects of things, they sometimes lose sight of their underlying purpose. When asked to judge entries in a science fair, for example, an ESTJ may be so caught up in the technicalities of the assignment that the overall goal of encouraging children to explore scientific interests is forgotten.\nUnder stress, ESTJs make decisions too hastily. They don’t give themselves time to reflect on alternatives. Even when things start going wrong, they’ll stick with their original plan and resist new information, vetoing suggestions for change. Their motto is, “That’s the way we’ve always done it.”\nESTJs who supervise INFJs may wonder why their employees dislike them. The reason is that INFJs have a horror of being micromanaged. They like to figure out their own ways of doing things. However, because bluntness is not their style, they tend to nurse grudges rather than confront ESTJ supervisors directly. Differences in the two types can be a source of irritation, although the INFJ will suffer more from any misunderstanding than the matter-of-fact ESTJ.\nLoving an ESTJ\nIn a new relationship with an ESTJ, you’re likely to find him or her spontaneous and easy-going at first. As time goes on, the ESTJ will revert to type and become more matter of fact. If you disappoint the person in some important way, he or she is likely to get angry and self-righteous. This is because ESTJs expect others to honor their standards.\nINFJs who are troubled and seek sympathy from an ESTJ partner are in danger of feeling short-changed. The partner is more comfortable looking for a practical solution than listening with a sympathetic ear.\nWhen conflicts arise in a relationship, efforts to explore underlying causes are generally ignored by the ESTJ. Insights are not the person’s long suit. If an argument gets heated enough, the ESTJ may explode and need help rebuilding their control. Tactfully, the INFJ can remind them of what’s really important. If the INFJ suggests counseling, the ESTJ will probably resist.\nDon’t expect romantic emotional displays from an ESTJ. The ESTJ will feel that his or her loyalty is the only proof of love that’s needed. Eloquence is not their style. They aren’t given to creative lovemaking, either. Once a routine for physical intimacy has been established, the ESTJ will resist attempts to introduce new techniques.\nLiving with an ESTJ\nIf you move in with an ESTJ, you’ll find that there’s a place for everything and everything is in its place. Your ESTJ partner will want clear arrangements about who does what. If the ESTJ volunteers to walk the dog, you can depend on it. No prodding will be needed. If you have children together, the ESTJ will send them off to school with lunch money, permission slips, and anything else they need for the day. If you’re behind in your own commitments, you can be sure you’ll be reminded of them.\nWhen you get frustrated by your partner’s lack of sensitivity, take comfort in the knowledge that ESTJs show their love by actions more than words. They’re loyal and keep their promises. If you feel that your needs are being ignored, the best approach is to explain tactfully and clearly what you’d like from them. They’ll probably try to improve communications. The more you can help an ESTJ relax and expand his or her views, the more you’ll enjoy each other.\nFamous ESTJs and INFJs\nESTJs known for their quick tempers include Lyndon Johnson, Bette Davis, and Herbert Hoover. In heated situations, they responded best to people who would hear them out and then suggest new insights. INFJ leaders famous for their ability to listen thoughtfully to others include Nelson Mandela, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Ghandi.\n","date":"August 2, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/1e4b91dd08c79c07e84bd21155510f72_hu00b73ad0124ff7687fb3e591d4b50e25_56901_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/1e4b91dd08c79c07e84bd21155510f72_hu00b73ad0124ff7687fb3e591d4b50e25_56901_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/infj-meets-estj-2/","title":"INFJ Meets ESTJ"},{"categories":["INFJ","ISFJ","Myers-Briggs Personality Types","Your Secret Self"],"contents":"INFJs are often drawn to INTPs because of their intelligence and ability to apply logic to every situation. Eventually, though, INFJs tend to find most INTPs distant because of their unemotional approach to life. The INTP is attracted to INFJs because of their compassion and spontaneity. But the qualities that drew them to an INFJ in the first place can eventually get on their nerves. To them, it’s sloppy to let feelings override logic. Because they’re so reserved, INTPs may have few friends.\nThis personality type is more attuned to impersonal systems and technical subjects than intimate topics. If you’re an INFJ who’s an animal lover, don’t expect the INTP to share your emotional bond with pets. Are your favorite causes fueled more by compassion than logic?\nThe INTP is unlikely to be enthusiastic about them. INFJs are idealists and INTPs are rationalists. Privacy and Space If you are close to an INTP, it’s important to give him or her plenty of space. INTPs need more time alone than other types. They don’t like being interrupted when they are focusing on something they’re doing. If their feelings are hurt, they won’t want to talk about it right away as INFJs do. They need time to process their feelings. Being pestered for a discussion of the problem only makes them more upset.\nSmall talk is not the forte of INTPs. They want to discuss things that are important, amusing or thought-provoking. They’d rather sit in silence than chat politely. Should the conversation turn to something they’re interested in, though, they can become long-winded and even boring. When apparently easy-going INTPs are challenged about their beliefs, they can be downright hard.\nFriends sometimes get the impression that the INTP is aloof and judgmental. That’s because INTPs are impatient with faults both in themselves and others. When they’re critical of something you’ve done, they probably haven’t meant to hurt you. In their problem-solving mode, they’ve forgotten to consider your feelings. Their perfectionism causes them to be hard on themselves, too. Personal failure is likely to make them depressed. Because they have trouble opening up to others, they suffer alone. They may not even be clear about what they feel or why they’re depressed.\nWork and Play The INTP’s mind may be organized, but his or her personal environment is not. INTPs make clear, logical plans to put things in order but seldom get around to it. Nothing changes and the mess remains.\nINTPs need plenty of private time to read, think, work at their computers or watch television. They’re partial to solitary activities although they enjoy companionship at times. When they play games, they prefer bridge, Monopoly, chess or other challenges to their problem-solving skills. They talk very little as they play, preferring to concentrate on their moves. They’re also competitive. When they get involved in a project, they’re more interested in the planning phase than in the actual execution. If the project involves drudgery, their motivation evaporates and they put it off.\nFalling in Love When INTPs fall in love, they fall hard. Passion consumes them. They step out of character—writing poetry, reading to their lover, and buying gifts. They ignore obstacles to romance such as distance, weather, and prior commitments. However, their common sense usually returns within a year. Even though they remain committed, they may seem to pull away and become more matter-of-fact. They still appreciate their partners; they just don’t talk much about their feelings. They’ve returned to their familiar pattern of solitude.\nWhen INTPs fall out of love, the decision is almost always final. A line has been crossed. The INTP allows the relationship to deteriorate and end, with no attempt to revive it. Break-ups can be messy, damaging the lives of many people. Bottom Line INTPs strive for logical purity. They are clear and quick-thinking, never accepting ideas that don’t make sense to them even though everyone else might regard them as the truth. They’re good at connecting unrelated thoughts and put considerable effort into analyzing and solving problems. They don’t want the help of others. For this reason, most have a distaste for meetings. They’d rather come up with ideas on their own and make plans independently. They also have a strong need to continue learning about areas that interest them. They’re committed to the life of the mind. Many prolong their formal education for years.\nIf you are a high-maintenance INFJ, be prepared to look beyond an INTP partner to meet all your emotional needs. INTPs don’t like to feel crowded.

They’re introverted, feeling, and judging. They differ only on the intuitive/sensing dimension of the Myers-Briggs Inventory. Both types put much of their energy into helping others and share a drive to make the world a better place. People can count on them in times of trouble.\nAlthough INFJs and ISFJs have high ideals, they’re modest about them. They prefer to make their values apparent in their actions. This is partly due to their introverted personalities and desire to avoid the spotlight. Seldom do they call attention to themselves or demand recognition for their achievements.\nThe main difference between INFJs and ISFJs is that INFJs are more perceptive. They pick up on the motives of others quickly. Because they’re so sharp at spotting phony behaviors in people, their judgments are sometimes harsh. On the other hand, ISFJs are somewhat naïve. They have a hard time understanding power-hungry people or those with self-serving motives. They are bewildered by greed and unkindness as it’s so foreign to their natures. INFJs and ISFJs complement each other because they meet somewhere in the middle. INFJs protect ISFJs from their gullibility, and ISFJs are models of tolerance.\nQuiet and unassuming, INFJs and ISFJs aren’t easy to get to know, but people close to them value their friendship.\nIn Love\nBoth INFJs and ISFJs take romantic relationships seriously and are attentive to their partners’ needs. In their speech and demeanor, they’re tactful and kind. At the same time, their introverted natures make them cautious about expressing their feelings for fear of rejection. These two types may be so cautious in their approach to romance that more extraverted partners get impatient with them. INFJs and ISFJs have a tendency to hold back on the playful aspects of their personalities until they know people well.\nINFJs and ISFJs sometimes remain in partnerships that are no longer working. The thought of leaving a relationship makes them nervous and insecure. When either of these types is left by a partner, they’re deeply hurt. Typically, their self-esteem suffers and they go through a period of painful self-examination.\nIf they don’t turn to friends for support, they’re slow to regroup and move on. Some grow quiet, trying to appear composed and stoic to the people around them. At Home\nThe homes of INFJs tend to be more cluttered than those of ISFJs. An abundance of books, crafts supplies, musical instruments, and other paraphernalia lie around the house, allowing INFJs to pursue their hobbies at a moment’s notice. While they would prefer a tidy environment, housekeeping has a lower priority than having fun. When family members complain about the mess, however, INFJs will pick up after themselves.\nISFJs’ homes are usually neater, as they’re more prompt about attending to home maintenance and domestic chores. Sometimes their sense of responsibility prompts them to take on more than they can handle. They may complain about their workload in a martyred sort of way, but then turn down offers of assistance from family members. To accept help makes them feel inadequate and guilty.\nCelebrations such as birthdays and anniversaries are important to ISFJs, who are more traditional than INFJs. To get the most enjoyment out of such events, they participate enthusiastically in the preparations—cooking the holiday meal, cleaning the house, and so on. This is one way they show their commitment and love.\nBoth Myers-Briggs types take their parenting responsibilities seriously. For them parenthood is a lifelong commitment. Protective and patient, they’re likely to set aside their own needs to be sure their children are taken care of first. They give them every opportunity for a good education, for example. While ISFJs tend to encourage their children along conventional career lines, INFJs are more broad minded. They’re tolerant of unusual extracurricular and career interests as long as their children put forth genuine effort.\nINFJs and ISFJs desire harmony above all. They want their partners and children to be happy. As a result, they sometimes sidestep family conflicts that should be resolved for the good of everyone.\nAt Work\nINFJs and ISFJs need careers that are consistent with their values and desire to serve others. ISFJs are generally satisfied with conventional careers that focus on short-term goals and hands-on attention to detail, while INFJs feel fulfilled only when their intuition and creativity are called into play and they’re involved in long-range planning and problem-solving.\nBoth personality types are averse to conflicts and stress in the workplace. INFJs can become rigid and uncommunicative in a competitive or intense work environment. Eventually, they look for another job. ISFJs are likely to keep trying, working harder in the hope that the situation will improve.\nGrowing Older\nINFJs and ISFJs enjoy their retirement years if they’re free of financial worries and have leisure time to pursue their interests. INFJs, once preoccupied with world problems, become more relaxed as they grow older, leaving many of their worries behind and enjoying the present. They’re likely to decide that the state of the world is the next generation’s problem.\nISFJs, always more now-oriented than INFJs, also enjoy being released from the time-consuming obligations that characterized their working years. With age, they become less self-critical and more extraverted. Their give their own needs and desires higher priority than they once did. Still, being of service to others remains important.\n","date":"August 2, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/53a4afcb98d6b66fccccc37c0c94eccc_huf01d8a38d2d9c5a4ebe43af1776107ea_84922_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/53a4afcb98d6b66fccccc37c0c94eccc_huf01d8a38d2d9c5a4ebe43af1776107ea_84922_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/infj-meets-isfj/","title":"INFJ meets ISFJ"},{"categories":["INFJ","ISFJ","Myers-Briggs Personality Types","Your Secret Self"],"contents":"As one of sixteen Myers-Briggs types, the INFJ is introverted (I), intuitive (N), feeling (F), and judging (J). A little different from the ISFP—who shares the introverted (I) and feeling (F) traits but not the intuitive (N) and judging (J) traits.\nBoth have a need for some privacy to collect themselves and regroup. If the INFJ says to an ISFP partner, “I think I’ll go out and straighten up the garage,” the ISFP is likely to interpret this as a need for time alone and say “Good idea,” rather than “Want me to come?” Or, if the ISFP heads outside with watercolors and paintbrush, the INFJ probably won’t offer to tag along. They both treasure their private space.\nTheir feeling (F) function makes them sensitive to each other’s needs—another Myers-Briggs trait they share. In fact, they base most of their personal decisions upon the impact they’ll have on others. Before making any large purchases, accepting invitations, or making important choices, they consult their partners.\nOf course, feelings still get hurt sometimes. After attending a party where the couple doesn’t know many people, the INFJ may comment, “My feelings were hurt when you left me stranded at the buffet table.” An ISFP partner doesn’t retort, “Well, can’t you take care of yourself?” He or she is more likely to say “Gosh, I’m sorry. I didn’t realize you felt that way.”\nTheir shared traits of introversion (I) and feeling (F) make them understand each other’s tendency to be shy.\nThey realize that both are too critical of themselves, tending to undervalue their skills. The positive aspect of this is that they can offer mutual reassurance. Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N)\nAn important difference between the INFJ and ISFP lies in their intuitive/sensing (I/S) functions. Intuitive types rely on their hunches to make decisions. They don’t take in all the details that the sensing person does, but they can draw sound conclusions without them. The sensing type has a watchful eye and misses nothing. In their world, decisions should be based on facts, not hunches.\nDriving home from a meeting, the sensing person may say, “Did you see the Rolex Jason was wearing and the Vuitton case he was carrying?” The intuitive partner may answer, “I thought something was up when he kept looking at his watch and opening his briefcase. What a show-off!”\nFalling in Love\nFalling in love is a major event for both INFJs and ISFPs. In the first stages of an affair, they’re seldom separated, immersing themselves in each other’s company. If the relationship continues, they’re usually loyal partners. One may even change careers or relocate for the good of the partnership.\nINFJs and ISFPs are good at entertaining each other with their wide-ranging interests and taste for adventure. Together they make take up new activities such as camping, art, or gourmet cooking. Of the two, the ISFP is inclined to be more graceful and athletic because they enjoy the feeling of their bodies in motion. They often excel at physical activities requiring both sensitivity and strength, such as dancing and figure skating.\nThe main problems that INFJs and ISFPs face usually stem from their tendency to avoid disagreements. They may fail to stand up for or even recognize their own emotional needs. If the air isn’t cleared and resentments are allowed to develop, the relationship can be damaged to the point where one or the other strays, looking for a more agreeable partner. This can be devastating for the person left behind, as both types are naturally vulnerable to rejection and prone to self-criticism.\nPerceiving (P) vs. Judging (J)\nThe couple’s differences in perceiving (P) and judging (J) can sometimes cause friction because the INFJ makes decisions more impulsively than the methodical ISFP. Perceiving (P) types like to postpone closure as long as possible, being more comfortable with open-ended situations.\nShopping for a printer, the INFJ may be satisfied with the prices and ratings on Amazon and be ready to order online. Not the ISFP. “I want to see what the print-outs look like,” says the ISFP. Or, “Maybe we can find a better price somewhere else.”\nUnless the INFJ appreciates the ISFP’s need to keep decisions open-ended until the last minute—and until the ISFP understands the INFJ’s impatience for closure—they may be in for some frustrating moments.\nBecause of their judging (J) function, INFJs rarely miss deadlines and are always on time for appointments. ISFPs, as perceivers (P), are inclined to make deadlines by the skin of their teeth and be anywhere from five to thirty minutes late for social events.

The only trait they have in common is their introversion. Both types enjoy privacy. They find meaning not from superficial experiences but from their contemplation of them.\nSensing vs. Intuition\nBecause ISTPs rely on their sensing preference more than their intuition, they are driven to understand how things work. They usually have good eye-hand coordination, which makes them skilled at fixing things. They use their minds for practical matters and think problems through while working on them. Theories don’t interest them unless they can be put to practical use.\nIn contrast, INFJs aren’t mechanically minded. They get impatient with details and prefer to head straight to outcomes. The ISTP can be a big help to the INFJ who doesn’t want to bother with, say, taking apart a toaster to see why it’s not working. If the problem is a blown fuse, that may occur to the INFJ intuitively while the ISTP works his or her way to the solution through logic. ISTPs are likely to examine the parts of the toaster before checking the fusebox. The two types have complementary strengths.\nWhen an ISTP and INFJ collect information to make a big decision, such as what car to buy, their sensing and intuitive functions may collide. The ISTP may not be satisfied until all aspects of a model are checked out and the vehicle is examined by a mechanic. The INFJ is more likely to base his or her decision on how the engine runs and if the car feels good to drive.\nThe ISTP’s private opinion is that the INFJ rushes to conclusions without taking enough precautions. The INFJ thinks the ISTP is too fussy about details. Thinking vs. Feeling\nWhen an ISTP-INFJ relationship runs aground, it’s usually because of thinking-feeling conflicts. ISTPs make decisions based on facts rather than feelings and values. This impersonal approach gives them a tendency to ignore the effects of their actions on others. They may not even be clear about their own feelings. INFJs’ emotions are more likely to influence their decisions, although they do examine the facts. Because of this difference, the ISTP can hurt the INFJ’s feelings without meaning to. The INFJ can get on the ISTP’s nerves with his or her emotional reactions.\nPerceiving vs. Judging\nBecause of their perceiving preference, ISTPs don’t worry much about deadlines and usually finish jobs just under the wire. They postpone starting projects and then rush to finish them on time. They’re often late for appointments. In contrast, INFJs work on a schedule, make lists, and make sure to meet their deadlines with time to spare. They plan projects. They don’t just jump in. In this arena, too, the INFJ and ISTP can get on each other’s nerves.\nMaking the Relationship Work\nIt takes effort and patience to make an ISTP-INFJ relationship work. The two must respect each other’s methods of processing information. The ISTP should try to understand the INFJ’s need for emotional support. Often this requires that the INFJ explain his or her needs to the ISTP and make suggestions for meeting them. INFJs shouldn’t expect ISTPs to be their sole source of emotional support. They need to cultivate a few friends who can empathize with their feelings and give them support.\nAs close friends, INFJs and ISTPs enjoy sharing experiences quietly, away from crowds. They’re most at ease when they’re camping, listening to music, or watching a documentary. Words aren’t necessary. The shared experience is enough.\nThe INFJ appreciates the ISTP’s ability to enjoy the details of life without over-thinking. ISTPs have a matter-of-fact, uncomplicated way of viewing the world. This can be a relief to the complex INFJ for whom very little is easy. Often the ISTP has practical solutions to the small problems of life: how to replace a bicycle chain, determining what’s causing the funny noise in the car engine, or figuring out what’s killing the roses in the yard.\n","date":"August 2, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/90d7cd1ac924b553e2322972bd8fa2d6_hueb0103b28e0c0b00940be17d3fb3cf88_29516_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/90d7cd1ac924b553e2322972bd8fa2d6_hueb0103b28e0c0b00940be17d3fb3cf88_29516_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/infj-meets-istp/","title":"INFJ Meets ISTP"},{"categories":["INFJ","ISFJ","Myers-Briggs Personality Types","Your Secret Self"],"contents":"INFJ men are complex, warm, and perceptive. They’re drawn to women who are intelligent, creative, and compassionate. While few INFJ men ever achieve perfect relationships, they always wish for them. This is a positive quality when they stay in a committed relationship but it works against them when they move from one woman to another, always seeking a partner who lives up to their ideals.\nIf you’re in a relationship with an INFJ male, your feelings won’t go unnoticed. He’ll pick up every nuance and shift in your mood. Sometimes you’ll think he can read your mind. He’s a skillful, attentive lover who won’t be happy unless he can give as much pleasure as he receives. He views lovemaking as a nearly spiritual experience and wants you to feel the same.\nHave no fear that he’ll leave you on a whim. He’s steadfast and loyal. Hurting people is not what he does. In fact, he has a tendency to hang on to partnerships long after they start going bad. If your relationship begins to deteriorate, you’re likely to see him struggling with himself. If he finally concludes that his efforts are useless, he’s likely to move on quickly. Don’t expect to go through a series of arguments. That’s not his style. There’ll be no shouting or fighting, just a quiet announcement that it’s over and time for him to go.\nIf your relationship stands the test of time, you can look forward to years of meaningful companionship. You’ll receive thoughtful gifts, favors and compliments. INFJ men enjoy showing their love, but they also like to hear that their efforts are appreciated. Getting material gifts from you isn’t necessary. They’re happy with your words of pleasure and gratitude.\nDon’t risk being dishonest with an INFJ man. You won’t get by with it for long. INFJs have little patience for people they consider fake or corrupt. They recognize lies quickly, even if they don’t say anything about it.\nYou may notice that other women are attracted to your INFJ partner. He may not realize this. He’s hard to resist because of his intelligence, warmth, and consideration. He has interesting ways of viewing the world. He inspires people to be their best. Yet because he’s a selfless person, he doesn’t recognize the impact he has on others. His modesty is part of his appeal.\nIf you’re lucky enough to find an INFJ man, don’t count on his making the first move. INFJs are rarely the first ones to initiate social contact. Ask whether he’d like to have coffee sometime. If he’s interested, you’ll know. Also, keep these pointers in mind:\nOn a date, don’t talk about designer labels, top ten music, and other superficial matters. This is a major put-off for INFJs, who enjoy the simple pleasures of life. Money and fads are of limited interest.\nLeave your hand-held devices at home unless you need them for directions to a theatre, restaurant, etc.\nDon’t flirt with other men. You won’t impress your INFJ man. He’ll worry that you’re an unreliable partner.\nDon’t suggest that you’re out for a temporary affair.\nDon’t pressure him into going places that involve crowds of people, unless they’re quiet spectator events such as concerts, art shows, etc. Remember, he’s an introvert.\nEven though he may talk about expensive places he can take you, let him know that your idea of a good date is spending time one-on-one with him—that you’d rather be picnicking next to a river in his company than eating at a five-star restaurant.\nIf your relationship moves on to sexual intimacy, take your time at lovemaking. Don’t rush the process. Savor every moment.\nDon’t lie to him, even about little things. He’ll pick up on it and your deceits will lower his opinion of you.\nBe patient about learning the INFJ’s innermost secrets. INFJs are more guarded than most Myers-Briggs types. If your partnership flourishes, he’ll eventually tell you everything.\nOf all sixteen types, the INFJ has the greatest capacity for love and compassion in a relationship. If you find an INFJ man, hang on. He’s one in a hundred.

She is drawn to the opposite sex, but few of them turn out to be long-term partners because they’re the wrong type. Still, the woman keeps trying. If she finally meets a man with a compatible personality and finds him moderately attractive, the connection usually strengthens.\nThe INFJ woman is compassionate, intelligent, and creative. While she longs for a perfect relationship, she seldom achieves her goal. Because of her adventurous, passionate nature. she keeps getting sidetracked by the wrong kind of man. The woman who has the patience and maturity to wait until the right man comes along is much more likely to find the match she seeks. Paradoxically, more often than not, it’s the man who finds her, not the other way around. When that finally happens—if it does—it’s up to the INFJ woman to respond and nourish the relationship.\nThe odds of finding an INFJ woman are small—sad but true. That’s because INFJs comprise only 1 percent of the population. Consequently, she finds reasons to get out and appear in places where the odds are more promising. If she’s out there, just by herself, the chances are that the right man will find her if there’s one around.\nA man who initiates a relationship with an INFJ woman soon learns if his feelings are reciprocated. The woman picks up every nuance and shift in his mood. Sometimes he has the uneasy feeling that she can read his mind.\nShe’s an attentive lover who isn’t satisfied until she can give as much love as she receives. To her, lovemaking is more than a physical event. It’s a mystical experience, worthy of her fullest attention and skill. She loses interest in men whose lovemaking is routine and rapid. The right man need not fear that his INFJ woman will leave him on an impulse. She’s loyal and steadfast. In fact, she’s sometimes too loyal, tending to give her heart to a man long after the relationship shows signs of deteriorating. When this happens, she struggles with herself. Once she makes the decision that things are going nowhere, she severs ties quickly and moves on. She’s not the type to go through a series of arguments or pleas. That’s not her style. She’ll just announce quietly that it’s time for her to leave.\nAn INFJ relationship that stands the test of time can go on for years—for a lifetime, in fact. She gives the man thoughtful gifts, compliments and favors. She aims to please. Responding in kind isn’t necessary, although she appreciates it. The INFJ woman is satisfied with her ability to make him happy.\nOther men are likely to be attracted to an INFJ woman. She may or may not notice. She’s hard to resist because all her good qualities make her attractive. Her partner needn’t worry about her being fickle, however. She’ll be loyal—under one condition. The man must return her love, show his devotion, and make her feel treasured. Above all, he should never make lovemaking a hurried event. It deserves all his skill and attention.\nShe’ll appreciate this more than anything else he can do. If she starts showing a desire to wander, it’s probably because he hasn’t fulfilled his end of the bargain. Do’s and Don’ts\nWhen courting an INFJ woman, men should keep several pointers in mind:\nDon’t talk about cars, sporting events, politics, or money, unless one of these topics interests her particularly. In general, she enjoys the simple, straightforward experiences in life. She’s interested in things that feed her curiosity and broad intelligence, that engage her emotions as well as her intellect. Leave your android or iPhone in your car or inside pocket. She hates competing with handheld devices. If you’ll notice, hers is put away somewhere and she devotes all her attention to you. Don’t flirt with other women. Keep your attention from wandering, at least where she can detect it. Otherwise, she’ll assume you are fickle and undependable. Don’t introduce the subject of the new relationship in terms that indicate you don’t want to get serious. This indicates to her that you’re unreliable and don’t find her attractive enough to merit further consideration. Don’t press her to attend events where there are crowds of people, at least not at first. Cocktail parties and crowded pop concerts are examples. Remember, she’s an introvert. Don’t brag about expensive places you could take her. She doesn’t care about money. Rather, find intimate, reassuring settings that are in good taste but not exceedingly pricey. Imply that it’s her company you value, not the experience of eating in a prestigious restaurant. If the relationship blossoms during sexual intimacy, take your time at foreplay. Tease and tempt her to make some moves of her own. Nothing turns a woman on more than a man with a slow hand. Don’t let any of your moves come as a surprise to her. Allot plenty of time for lovemaking—at least an hour. Learn how to kiss, slowly and tentatively at first. No tongue, please. If you could listen to women complaining to each other about bad kissers, this is one of the first resentments you’ll hear. When the woman initiates French kissing, it’s OK to respond in kind, but slowly, tentatively. Don’t lie to her about anything, even little things. She’ll pick up on it, and your relationship will suffer from then on. It takes a lot of work and compassion to repair the damage done by even small deceits. An INFJ woman needs to trust you. Don’t pressure her to reveal her innermost secrets. She’ll start to share them with you when she’s ready and believes she can trust you completely. If the relationship is solid, eventually she’ll tell you everything. Of all sixteen types, the INFJ has the greatest store of love and compassion to give in a relationship. If you find an INFJ woman, treasure her.

Both are introverted, feeling, and judging. They differ only on the intuitive/sensing (N/S) dimension of the Myers-Briggs Inventory. Both types put much of their energy into helping others. They share a need to make the world a better place. People can count on them in times of trouble.\nAlthough both have high ideals, they’re modest about them. They prefer to make their values apparent in their actions. This is partly due to their introverted personalities and desire to avoid the spotlight. Seldom do they demand recognition for their achievements.\nThe main difference between the two is that INFJs are more insightful. For example, they pick up on the motives of others quickly, and as a result, their judgments are sometimes harsh. ISFJs, however, tend to be naive. They have a hard time understanding greed and unkindness because it’s so foreign to their natures.\nINFJs and ISFJs complement each other because they meet somewhere in the middle. INFJs protect ISFJs from their gullibility, and ISFJs are models of tolerance. Friendship\nINFJs and ISFJs make steadfast friends. The INFJ appreciates the generosity of ISFJs and their willingness to help others. INFJs show their gratitude in warm and subtle ways. ISFJs don’t have many friends, but they’re likely to keep the ones they have for a lifetime. Feeling secure in their friendships is important to both of them.\nINFJs should realize that most ISFJs have trouble standing up for themselves because they dislike conflict. ISFJs may make up white lies or excuses to avoid uncomfortable truths. For example, some ISFJs committed to abstinence from liquor, fearing disapproval, may turn down drinks with the excuse that they’re allergic to alcohol—yet most INFJ friends understand their discomfort are unlikely to take issue with their abstinence.\nRomance\nBoth INFJs and ISFJs take romantic relationships seriously and are attentive to their partners’ needs. They’re tactful and kind. At the same time, their introverted natures make them cautious about expressing their feelings for fear of rejection. These two types may be so careful in their approach to romance that they underestimate a partner’s commitment. INFJs and ISFJs have a tendency to hold back on the playful aspects of their personalities until they know people well.\nOnce the INFJ and ISFJ have decided on an exclusive relationship, they enjoy building a history together. They share certain activities on a regular basis, such as Friday night movies, and are sentimental about the things they do routinely. As the relationship matures, they return to places where they had their first dates. They like to exchange presents that will hold symbolic memories later—for example, artwork or CD albums. The INFJ in particular has no need for splashy gifts.\nINFJs and ISFJs sometimes remain in partnerships that are no longer working. The thought of leaving a relationship makes them nervous and insecure. When either of these types is left by a partner, they’re deeply hurt. Typically, they go through a period of painful self-examination. If they don’t turn to friends for support, they’re slow to regroup and move on. Some grow quiet, trying to appear composed and stoic to the people around them.\nHome Life\nThe homes of INFJs tend to be more cluttered than those of ISFJs. An abundance of books, craft supplies, musical instruments, and other paraphernalia lie around the house, allowing INFJs to pursue their hobbies at a moment’s notice. While they would prefer a tidy environment, housekeeping has a lower priority than having fun. When family members complain about the mess, however, INFJs will pick up after themselves.\nISFJs’ homes are usually neater, as they’re good about home maintenance and domestic chores. Sometimes they take on more than they can handle. Then they may complain about their workload in a martyred sort of way, but turn down offers of assistance from family members. To accept help makes them feel inadequate and guilty.\nCelebrations such as birthdays and anniversaries are important to ISFJs. To get the most enjoyment out of such events, they participate in the preparations—cooking the holiday meal, cleaning the house, and so on. This is one way they show their commitment and love.\nBoth Myers-Briggs types take their parenting responsibilities seriously. For them, parenthood is a lifelong commitment. Protective and patient, they’re likely to set aside their own needs to be sure their children are taken care of first. They give them every opportunity for a good education, for example. While ISFJs tend to encourage their children along conventional career lines, INFJs are more broad minded. They’re tolerant of unusual extracurricular and career interests as long as their children put forth genuine effort.\nSecrets of Success\nINFJs and ISFJs do best when they appreciate their differences as well as their similarities. While the ISFJ may not be as creative or witty as the INFJ, he or she is better at the practical aspects of life. When INFJs lose things—which they do with regularity—ISFJs can find them. When there are monotonous chores that the INFJ wishes to avoid, he or she is likely to find a willing volunteer in the ISFJ.

INFJ Meets ISFJ"},{"categories":["INFJ","ISFJ","Myers-Briggs Personality Types","Your Secret Self"],"contents":"Myers-Briggs Inventory\nIsabel Myers and her mother, Katharine Briggs—both psychologists— developed the Myers-Briggs Personality Inventory more than fifty years ago.\nCarl Jung They were looking for a way to classify different types of personalities and describe them using the theories of Carl Jung, the famous Swiss psychoanalyst. They wanted to create a tool to help people understand themselves and others.\nThe Myers-Briggs Inventory was first published in 1975. Its practical applications have been expanding ever since—in schools and colleges, business, counselors’ offices, and other settings.\nThe Myers-Briggs scale consists of four pairs of personality traits—each representing opposite ends of a continuum. Myers-Briggs test scores show where an individual’s personality lies along each continuum, with capital letters used to identify the dominant traits. Introversion-Extraversion\nThe introvert (I) needs privacy and solitude, generally avoids large social gatherings, and is happiest either alone or in the company of one or two good friends. The extravert (E) gets uneasy when alone too much, seeks the company of others, and enjoys mingling.\nIntuition-Sensing\nIntuitive (N) people tend act on their hunches, which are usually sound. They’re skilled at sizing up others and knowing when situations are risky. At the other end of the scale, people of the sensing (S) type don’t trust impulsive judgments. They prefer solid data and rely on what they can see and feel. Privately the intuitive type thinks the sensing type is earthbound and unimaginative, while the sensing type thinks the intuitive type is impulsive.\nThinking-Feeling\nThe thinker (T) is ordinarily rational and cool when making decisions—not prone to emotional reactions. The feeling (F) person is more likely to be swayed by sentimental considerations and has a softer heart.\nJudging -Perceiving\nThe judging (J) type is more focused and comfortable with closure than the perceiving (P) type. People with a dominant judging function rarely miss deadlines or are tardy for appointments. The perceiving type is more happy-go-lucky, often has several projects going at once, and is more casual about deadlines.\nWhen making a major purchase such as a car, the perceiving type enjoys the information-gathering and comparison-shopping part, but is a little uneasy once a selection has been made—worrying that more research should have been done. The judging person is glad the purchase has been decided upon and the check written.\nIt’s Hard To Be an INFJ\nINFJs make up only 1% to 3% of the population, the rarest of the personality types. They tend to be perfectionists who fear they aren’t living up to their potential. INFJs can always list the things they’ve left undone but have a hard time counting their accomplishments.\nINFJs hold strong convictions and are deeply affected by the suffering of others. However, because they are introverted, they prefer thinking about weighty issues to talking about them. Those who are activists—a role toward which they gravitate—take up causes for moral reasons, not for personal glory or political power.\nThe INFJ is often found at disaster scenes as a rescue worker. When a person of this type sees people or animals being treated cruelly, he or she may fantasize about getting revenge on the perpetrators. Although INFJs are gentle by nature, they are formidable in battle.\nThe highly developed intuition of INFJs warns them when trouble lies ahead—for themselves or the world. Some people find INFJs pessimistic or even a little paranoid. However, INFJs are more often right than wrong because their intuition is so accurate. This ability makes them effective problem-solvers with the ability to act insightfully and spontaneously. When INFJs move into their extraverted mode, as they sometimes do, they can express a range of emotions and opinions quite effectively as they have excellent verbal skills. However, they tend to be cautious about revealing their positions. Like other feeling-judging types, they frequently feel caught between the desire to express their opinions and their reluctance to offend people. Some INFJs vent their private feelings to a few trusted friends. The friends are chosen with care, and the relationships are usually characterized by affection and trust.\nWhen INFJs turn from their feeling to their thinking function, they may appear aloof. Others sometimes conclude that this detachment reflects cynicism. A friend might fear that the insightful INFJ is so perceptive about human nature that the friend himself or herself is being judged. Generally this is not true at all. The INFJ is simply distracted by the need to focus and think. Under stress, INFJs are likely to overlook what’s going on in their immediate environment.\n","date":"August 2, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/a5cd084cae0975f8c7ecab50067eace1_hu67a505610d5890e2a59d70a70dd681d6_87307_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/a5cd084cae0975f8c7ecab50067eace1_hu67a505610d5890e2a59d70a70dd681d6_87307_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/its-hard-to-be-an-infj/","title":"It’s Hard To Be an INFJ—The Rarest Myers-Briggs Personality Type"},{"categories":["INFJ","ISFJ","Myers-Briggs Personality Types","Your Secret Self"],"contents":"Since posting “It’s Hard To Be an INFJ” on this blog, I’ve received hundreds of e-mails from other INFJs.

Their posts and my responses appear after that blog.\nThis is my personal account of what it feels like to be an INFJ.\nGrowing up\nAs a child, I felt like an outsider. I’ve felt this way most of my life. Even though all evidence suggests that I was successful and respected by my peers in school, I knew that I was an odd duck. I never liked large groups of kids. I preferred being alone or in the company of one friend—a typical preference of INFJs. Most introverts tend to feel insecure about their preference for privacy because of the high value our culture places on extraversion. People who enjoy being alone are considered odd.\nAs a student in elementary and high school, I did well academically and had two close friends. For an INFJ, I was surprisingly active in extracurricular activities: acting in community theatre, studying the piano accordion and sometimes performing publicly, editing the school paper, and so on. I was like two people—one who appeared successful and the other who always felt a little lost.\nWhen I left home for college at the age of 17 and began to date, my relationships with boys were fragile. If I fell in love, I couldn’t figure out how to hang onto the boy. He usually tired of my neediness and left.\nIf a boy I didn’t care for kept pursuing me, I couldn’t figure out how to escape without hurting him. With my overactive feeling function, relationships with boyfriends put me on emotional rollercoaster rides. Personality Traits\nLike most judging types, I’ve always been highly focused. I’ll stay up all night working on a project, never miss a deadline, and be punctual for appointments. I like closure, not uncertainty. I make decisions quickly. Thanks to my highly developed intuition, they tend to turn out well.\nMy opinions on social and political issues are pretty unshakeable, without shades of gray. I recognize the problems my inflexible positions can cause, however, and try to open my mind to other perspectives. When I have strong feelings about an issue, I share them with only one or two trusted friends. I am generally not a leader of causes in public. I write about them passionately, though.\nMy intuitive, feeling, and judging functions, acting in concert, make me quick to respond to emergencies, especially those involving injury or danger to people or animals. Even at age 82, I still rush into threatening situations. I always emerge unharmed because my intuitive function steers me away from personal danger while my emotions give me the courage and force to act.\nCareer Experience\nLike me, many INFJs are writers. We make good investigative journalists, science editors, and nonfiction writers. The social sciences interest us more than physics, mathematics, electronics and other theoretical and physical sciences. The social sciences engage our feeling function. On aptitude tests, we excel on the verbal portions. However, our thoughts usually have a strong visual component. What we describe in words we see in pictures. We’re more concrete than abstract. Highly creative INFJs are drawn to careers like acting, painting, designing, and so on. However, they are more concerned with pursuing truth than creating art.\nBecause of their creativity, many INFJs are successful entrepreneurs. They’re good at coming up with fresh ideas, taking risks, introducing new products, marketing to the public, and trouble-shooting. All the while, they maintain their idealism and desire to make life better for those around them. If they get too caught up in the profit motive and are seduced by materialistic goals, they end up demoralized. They suffer from stagnation, burnout, and loss of creativity.\nIn my early 60s, I earned over $250,000 a year for three years in a row. (I saved most of it and am now enjoying the fruits of my intuitively guided investments.) The problem with all that money was that I became too attached to it. It made me feel very important. Ultimately, my confidence and self-esteem relied on my six-figure income. Approaching retirement, I realized that money could be a trap. I needed to release this attachment and start volunteering. I began to give more money to causes I believed in—mostly animal welfare, education of children in developing countries, and women’s rights. Now, at 82, I have all the money I need to feel safe and enjoy myself. When I work, I don’t accept money for my professional services. Charging money would spoil my pleasure.\nLife Can Be Hard\nLife can be difficult for those of us who share INFJ traits. First, we’re often misunderstood—perhaps because we make up only one percent of the population. There aren’t enough of us around. Although we often don’t recognize a fellow INFJ when we meet, we’re likely to become fast friends once we recognize the common ground we stand on. Here’s how each of the four traits challenges us:\nIntroversion: Our preference for privacy can isolate us. We retreat into our thoughts too much and can find ourselves in a cycle of brooding.\nIntuition: While well-developed intuition is a gift, it seldom makes us popular. Because the intuitive individual can seem almost clairvoyant, he or she can make others feel uncomfortable. Our forecasts usually turn out to be true, but in the passage of time they’re usually forgotten so we go without credit. We may become so confident of our insights as the years pass that we’re shaken by the rare occasions when they’ve led us down the wrong path.\nFeeling: The truths that underlie our accurate insights can wound us. For example, if I have a hunch a friend is lying to me, the chances are I’m right. Knowing this and having it confirmed can be more painful than it is for people whose dominant function is thinking. Although our feelings often bring us joy, when they’re negative we suffer, particularly when rejection is involved. Many of us are prone to depression.\nJudging: Our judging function can lead us into premature decisions with uncomfortable consequences, especially in relationships. Many a marriage has foundered because an INFJ didn’t take enough time to understand his or her partner fully before the wedding. (I’m an example of this—more than once.) As the saying goes, “Marry in haste, repent at leisure.” In groups of people, INFJs may appear aloof, even arrogant, because they’re concentrating on sizing up others before they can relax.\nWe’re in Good Company\nINFJs are in good company. Famous INFJs of the past and present are Mahatma Gandhi, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Carl Jung, Simone de Beauvoir, Eleanor Roosevelt, Mother Teresa, Noah Chomsky, and Oprah Winfrey.\n","date":"August 2, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/19ff89d055f949fd7f88b531720ed67d_hu20acaa9467625afae5703a27ded356d8_100124_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/19ff89d055f949fd7f88b531720ed67d_hu20acaa9467625afae5703a27ded356d8_100124_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/its-hard-to-be-an-infj-the-authors-personal-story/","title":"It’s Hard To Be an INFJ: The Author’s Personal Story"},{"categories":["INFJ","ISFJ","Myers-Briggs Personality Types","Your Secret Self"],"contents":"Perceiving (P) and Judging (J) are a set of opposite traits on the Myers-Briggs Personality Inventory. They are called the attitude traits. The other three sets are Extraversion vs. Introversion (energy), Sensing vs. Intuition (information-processing), and Thinking vs. Feeling (decision-making). Differences in the J-P function may cause considerable friction among opposites—particularly between the Judger, for example, who is always on time for appointments and the Perceiver who always arrives late.\nThe differences between a Perceiver and Judger are hard to hide on a day-to-day basis. Concealing one’s type is not all that difficult for other types. For example, an Introvert may have cultivated enough interpersonal and communications skills that he or she can come across as an Extravert. This is not uncommon.\nOr a smooth-talking Thinker may come across as a Feeling type when he or she is anything but. The J-P difference, on the other hand, is difficult to mask. The differences between the two types are seen in the following example.\nP: I saw the new library building this morning. P: It must hold a lot of books. P: The library will be open evenings.\nJ: I saw it, too. The architecture is beautiful. It must have cost a pretty penny. J: I’ll look forward to a larger selection of books now. J: I’m glad it will be open evenings. I can go after work.\nNotice that the Perceiver makes no judgments about the new library. She’s seen it. It’s big. And it’s open in the evenings. On the other hand, the Judger’s remarks are full of value statements. The architecture is “beautiful.” He looks forward to a larger selection of books. He’s happy that he can now visit the library after work. These three statements have considerably more attitudinal closure—the hallmark of the Judger—than those made by the Perceiver.\nThis example is pretty tame compared with many of the scenarios faced by couples, based on their attitudes and outlook. In real life, both parties can get irritated by the obtuseness of the other. The Judger has an opinion, a plan, and a schedule for nearly everything. Perceivers, meanwhile, seem wishy-washy with their lack of opinions. They are easygoing about everything short of life-and-death issues.\nNeither function, Perceiving or Judging, is better than the other. We need both types in the world. J’s need P’s to inspire them to relax, collect more information before reaching a decision, and not make major issues of relatively unimportant matters. P’s need J’s to help them get organized and follow through on decisions.\nJudgers can be described as orderly and organized. Their actions are controlled. They’re always on schedule. They seem to make decisions quickly with a minimum of stress—far too quickly for the anxious Perceiver. Judgers plan their work and their daily activities and then stick to the plan, Even leisure time is organized. For Judgers, there’s a right way and a wrong way to do everything.\nPerceivers try to create an environment that allows them to be flexible and spontaneous. They want to be ready to adapt to a variety of conditions that can’t be predicted. Making and sticking to decisions prematurely causes them anxiety. The person whose friends have trouble understanding where he or she stands on specific issues is usually a Perceiver—flexible, open, and not judgmental.\nAt their respective extremes, the Perceiver is almost incapable of making decisions. Judgers find it almost impossible to change theirs.\n","date":"August 2, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/2ab7f4a6e2cba2882017473b556d3be8_hufb608a2a094010713c05c5144336261b_66244_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/2ab7f4a6e2cba2882017473b556d3be8_hufb608a2a094010713c05c5144336261b_66244_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/perceiving-vs-judging-the-conflict/","title":"Perceiving vs. Judging—The Dating Game"},{"categories":["INFJ","ISFJ","Myers-Briggs Personality Types","Your Secret Self"],"contents":"In the dating game, the Sensing and Intuitive Myers-Briggs preferences can be a source of excitement and, at the same time, confusion.\nSensors are realistic about dating partners. They judge other people by what they do and say. Being grounded in objective reality, they aren’t impressed by phony facades or bragging. They clearly see the good and the bad in the here and now. Intuitives, with their active imaginations, are more titillated by the possibilities in their minds than what’s actually taking place in the present. They extrapolate from the evidence in front of them and don’t take it at face value. Sensors may fantasize, too, but they’re more likely to do it after the fact. Their perceptions in the moment must agree with what’s going on in reality, rather than their wishful thinking about the future.\nSensors are more tuned to their senses: how the date looks and sounds, whether he or she smells nice and has agreeable tastes in music and food. For them, the dating experience happens through the five senses. Intuitives are more interested in their hunches about the person. They experience dates more in the sense of potential for the future.\nThe Intuitive is more interested in images conjured up by their imaginations—in other words, what the date should be like, more than what he or she actually is. For Sensors, the date begins only when the two parties stand face to face. For Intuitives, the date begins as soon as arrangements are made. That leaves plenty of time to fantasize about possibilities.\nOne problem arises when the two types actually get together for their date. Sensors may have trouble following the Intuitive’s many trains of thought. Because good conversation is a major factor in the early phases of the dating game, the differences between the two types begin to emerge sooner rather than later. Sensors like to talk about concrete things: people they’ve met, experiences they’ve had, places they’ve been—with specifics provided in detail. Intuitives would rather talk about their dreams, visions, ideas, and other intangibles.\nOne aggravating problem for both parties lies in the details each provides. Sensing partners tend to interrupt the stories of their partners with corrections about dates, places, and so on. The Intuitive is less interested in minute details than in the main theme of the story.\nHere’s an example of a story about poor restaurant service that Joe is telling friends:\nJoe: We were eating at Chez Pierre, and they brought me a Martini instead of a Bloody Mary.\nSusan: They brought you a Manhattan by mistake.\nJoe: Then it took almost an hour to deliver my entrée.\nSusan: It was 40 minutes.\nJoe: And the trout wasn’t even cooked thoroughly.\nSusan: You ordered grouper that night.\nYou can see how this couple could run into irritating conflicts over time—with the Sensing person aggravated by her partner’s factual errors and the Intuitive’s annoyance at being interrupted and contradicted like a small child.\nFor Sensors, it’s important that facts be presented correctly. The details are as important as flow and underlying meaning. For the Intuitive, the underlying message takes stage center.\n","date":"August 2, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/e835509e127040eb3fd3416cb856355f_hu00f9d7051d29f8ca593b85a8e20057d5_108680_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/e835509e127040eb3fd3416cb856355f_hu00f9d7051d29f8ca593b85a8e20057d5_108680_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/sensors-vs-intuitives-the-dating-game/","title":"Sensors vs. Intuitives—The Dating Game"},{"categories":["MBTI"],"contents":"\rMore confusion probably exists regarding Sensors (S) and Intuitives (N) than any other type. Extraverts (E) and Introverts (I) are easy to tell apart. So are Thinkers (T) and Feelers (F). The labels themselves are giveaways. Perceiving (P) and Judging (J) require a bit of observation to figure out. Is the person usually late for deadlines and appointments? Does he or she avoid making final decisions on things as long as possible? That’s typical of a Perceiver. Judging types rarely miss deadlines and are seldom late for appointments. They verge on compulsive. They make decisions easily because they prefer closure to open-ended situations. You don’t have to know the Judger or Perceiver for long to figure out which type they are. The Sensing and Intuitive types are more elusive.\nSensing Type\n• Sensors prefer being involved in the here and now rather than thinking about what’s next. They would rather do things than think about them.\n• They like tasks with tangible outcomes rather than vague promises. They’d rather pressure-wash the driveway themselves than look around for a budget-friendly handyman to do the job.\n• They believe that “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” If the toaster isn’t working the way it used to, it’s better to improvise to get the desired outcome than take it apart or to an appliance repair person.\n• Sensors prefer dealing with facts and figures, not abstract ideas and theories. They like to hear about things in a logical order, not randomly.\n• They read magazines from front to back rather than diving into them anywhere.\n• They dislike it when people give them vague instructions rather than stepwise details. “Here’s the overall plan. We’ll discuss the details later,” is the type of communication that frustrates them.\n• Sensors are literal in their use of words. If they say, “Be careful. The coffee is boiling hot,” it probably is. The Intuitive might mean that the coffee is just uncomfortably warm. • At work, Sensors focus on their own jobs and responsibilities rather than their importance to the overall organization. Intuitive Type\n• Intuitives can think about several things at the same time. They’re often accused of being absent-minded.\n• They’re usually more concerned about where they’re headed than where they are. Future possibilities interest them more that present realities.\n• Intuitives like to figure out how things work as much for the fun of it as anything else. Toaster broken? The Intuitive is right there to take it apart and fix it.\n• They’re prone to making puns and playing word games. They enjoy language for its own sake.\n• They’re good at seeing the interconnectedness between things. They don’t just want to know the facts. They want to know the meaning behind the facts. Reading the newspaper is an entirely different experience for the Intuitive and the Sensor.\n• Intuitives tend to give general answers to questions rather than specific details. If the intuitive is asked how far it is to Jacksonville, he or she might answer, “about a 2-hour drive” when what the Sensor wants to hear is, “86 miles.”\n• They’d rather fantasize about how they’re going to spend their next paycheck than sit down and balance their checkbook.\n⚡The “secret ingredient” to lasting commitment ! ⚡\nA Little of Both\nIf you’re like most people you’re neither 100 percent Sensing nor 100 percent Intuitive. One trait will tend to be dominant, however. Myers and Briggs specified that the traits are “preferences” suggesting that it’s possible to modify them some of the time. This is particularly obvious in the Thinking and Feeling preferences. While the Thinker may be logical and dispassionate about decisions most of the time, he or she may turn almost entirely to the Feeling preference if the family dog is injured. The Thinker will engage Feeling preferences for the occasion, putting everything aside, including finances, for the welfare of the pet.\nIt’s normal for the preferences to be modified according to different situations. In most social circumstances you might be an Extravert, but it’s natural that you should need some private time as an Introvert now and then. The balance between the two traits on each of the four pairs depends on a number of factors, but the overall tendencies are usually stable.\n⚡The “secret ingredient” to lasting commitment ! ⚡\n","date":"April 8, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/74ca700e4a6822007a9a44d3d594d2f3_hu0316dbcd7ab0a83d7011698f3102573a_123587_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/74ca700e4a6822007a9a44d3d594d2f3_hu0316dbcd7ab0a83d7011698f3102573a_123587_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/are-you-a-sensor-or-an-intuitive/","title":"Are You a Sensor or an Intuitive?"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\rAt an upscale restaurant with two women friends the other night, I watched one play with her android nonstop during dinner.

If the grain were exported, it would increase the U.S. trade balance by $80 billion per year.\nThe American system of feeding livestock grain rather than allowing cattle to feed on pastureland consumes resources far disproportionate to the yield. What’s more it accelerates soil erosion, uses huge amounts of water, and affects world food supply in a negative way.\nGrass-fed livestock yields more than the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of meat and dairy protein. While it’s true that the protein yield of beef is greater than that achieved by high-protein plants in the human diet, it is only 1.4 times more nutritious in comparable amounts. And with the quantities the average American eats in a day, the protein yield is more than enough to meet the RDA.\nAccording to animal production data that tracks use of fossil energy from the feed trough to the dinner table, broiler chickens provide the most efficient use of fossil energy—beef the least. Producing chicken meat consumes energy in a 4:1 ratio to protein output, whereas the ratio is 54:1 for beef. Mutton is nearly as inefficient at 50:1.\nAnimal agriculture is a leading user of water resources in the U.S. For every kilogram of meat produced by grain-fed beef production, 100,000 liters of water are required, Chickens take dramatically less to make a kilogram of meat: 3500 liters of water per kilogram. In contrast, soybean production uses only 2000 liters. Potatoes require 500 liters.\nWith severe water shortages in the Western and Southern U.S., the situation is rapidly worsening as the growing population needs more and more water to meet its needs—not only urban users, but also farmers and ranchers. Facts\nLivestock are responsible for much of the soil erosion in the U.S. Soil loss averages 13 tons per hectare annually on lands where grain feed is produced. Pasture lands erode, too, but at half the pace: 6 tons per hectare annually.\nThe 7 billion livestock in the U.S. eat five times as much grain as the entire population.\nOn the average, animal protein production in the U.S. uses 28 kcal for every kcal of protein produced for human consumption. Beef and mutton are the most costly in terms of fossil fuel energy input to protein output (54.1 and 50.1, respectively).\nU.S. farms and ranches account for 87 percent of all fresh water used each year. While livestock directly consume only 1.3 percent of that water, when the water for forage and grain is included, the water use figure rises dramatically. Every kilogram of beef uses 100,000 liters of water compared with 900 to produce a kilogram of wheat.\nThe U.S. produces almost 7 million tons of animal protein per year, enough to supply every American man, woman, and child with 75 grams per day The RDA of protein for a mixed diet—meat and plant sources combined—is 56 grams per day.\nIf all the grain now fed to livestock in the U.S. were exported and ranchers switched to grass-fed beef, the average American diet would drop from 75 to 29 grams of protein per day. That plus levels of average plant-protein consumption would yield more than the RDA for adults.\n","date":"April 8, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/c26ad8d87ab75953bdd2a02fda5e1fbf_huecd96197a79c7c1ae683fa752a3914db_31293_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/c26ad8d87ab75953bdd2a02fda5e1fbf_huecd96197a79c7c1ae683fa752a3914db_31293_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/environmental-cost-of-meat/","title":"Environmental Cost of Meat"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\rWith advancing age, their Myers-Briggs personality scores of people can change, but not by much. Extreme scores on one or more traits tend to soften and move toward the middle. The ESTJ who had a strong thinking (T) score is likely to move a little toward Feeling, with stronger emotional elements in their personality than previously. This blog describes the eight Extraverted (E) types in their retirement years. Every combination of traits is represented, making eight in all—Extraverted plus Sensing (S) or Intuition (N), Thinking (T) or Feeling (F), and Perceiving (P) or. Judging (J).\nESTPs in Retirement\nESTP elders continue to have the same characteristics they did when younger. Many of them choose to retire early so they’ll have more time to do the things that are fun. They like activities which require solving problems that are often difficult and tense. While they may take part in various organizations, they avoid leadership positions. Taking charge is not in their repertoire. They become involved mainly for the activities.\nWhen grandchildren arrive, the elders take pleasure in outings to the zoo, sports events, and so on. Children love their spontaneity and ability to improvise games on the spot. ESTJs in retirement\nBecause ESTJs often have a long history in of employment, their financial needs may be taken care of. However, they’ve become so accustomed to work that the idea of full-time leisure may intimidate them. Unless they’ve developed personally during their younger years to include activities that are flexible and rewarding, they may find retirement difficult. Many compensate by learning to think in terms of priorities and start making lists. Removing the spontaneity factor and therefore absolved from dealing with the emotional content of activities is more comfortable. ESTJs are efficiency devotees. It something is not on their list, they forget about it even though it may be of immediate importance and others may try to sidetrack them.\nESFPs in retirement\nIn retirement, ESFPs continue their people-oriented life, keeping old friends and continuing to provide the amusement and comradeship of years past. They have an optimism that is contagious and draws others to them. When ESFPs have unfortunate experiences, they’re often able to look at the sunny side. While some nursing home residents despair about their futures, ESFPs are likely to enjoy new friends, freedom from responsibilities, and new activities to participate in.\nBecause their friends of the past have enjoyed them so much over the years, they’re unlikely to abandon the friendship. The want to help out where they can. ESFJs in retirement\nESFJ elders don’t change much in their relationships after retirement. They keep doing nice, thoughtful things for others, and their company is a pleasure. They continuing scheduling lunches and other outside activities with former colleagues. They make follow-up calls and send notes. If they have grandchildren, they’ll help the parents in any way they can—baby-sitting, picking up the children at school, taking them on outings, and so on. Whatever they can do for others around them to make experiences more enjoyable, they do. It makes them feel good that others appreciate their efforts.\nENFPs in retirement\nENFPs remain young in spirit as they age, maintaining characteristics from their youth such as a zestful enjoyment of life, curiosity, and enthusiasm. As a result, people of all ages, including children, enjoy their company. They look forward to retirement as a time when they’ll be free of the restrictions and boundaries of the work world and can take pleasure in activities for which they’ve never had enough time when employed. Because they look for possibilities before realities, some of their activities may not be considered age-appropriate, such as joining the Peace Corps. However, if they become disabled or suffer from lack of money, they may get depressed because of all the opportunities missed.\nENFJs in retirement\nENFJs leaving full-time employment often look for places to live where they have family and friends or other close personal ties. Relationships and values were always important to this type, but they become even more so in retirement. Many ENFJs who previously did service work on the job, look for similar opportunities on a volunteer basis. They do this gladly, believing that an important goal in life is to help others. One of the lessons many need to learn is to let others help them some of the time. They are so used to giving help that it’s hard for them to imagine accepting it. ENFJs go out of their way to encouraging their grandchildren, reading to them, helping them with homework, etc.\nENTPs in retirement\nENTP have many inspiring ideas and projects during their working years, and these continue into retirement. While they may not have planned financially for these years, they have certainly given a lot of thought to the types of things they dream of doing. However, money may be a problem. Since it’s likely that they’ve changed jobs a number of times, they may have no stable retirement income to depend upon. However, they remain enthusiastic about their ideas and may find other lucrative means of earning a living that use their ingenuity. Some start new businesses that generate enough income to support their interests in old age. The desire for challenge, newness, variety and change don’t disappear as the years pass.\nENTJs in retirement\nAll their lives, ENTJs have been rewarded with leadership positions at work and in community organizations. They have always had a strategy in which potential for future gain outweighs risks. Because they are hard drivers with strong goal orientation, the prospect of retirement and long lazy days may be daunting to them. Inactivity makes them restless and the thought of filling their time with nothing of consequence dismays them. The chances are that finances are no problem because their careers have been so successful. Many continue to work as consultants to the same firms where they were previously employed.\nMaintaining autonomy is one of their major retirement goals. They need to learn to rely on others some of the time even though it’s difficult for them.

Much of the difference can be traced back to Myers-Briggs type. Some types are more sexual than others. Both INFJ men and women are intense and creative in their love lives.\nLet’s say you’ve met an INFJ woman and she fascinates you. After initial contact, you ask her out, and she’s agreed to a date. You’ve concluded that this is not a throwaway date. This is one you’d like to keep. How do you maximize your chances of forming a deeper relationship?\nArrive at her place on time—no more than five minutes late. She’s a prompt person and she respects that quality in others. To her, it’s a sign of respect. Wear clean, freshly laundered clothes. If she can smell the detergent, so much the better. Also, it goes without saying, shower first. Then shave. If you have facial hair, trim it closely and neatly. Some women dislike facial hair. This is an issue you can follow up on later if you wish. Skip the cologne or aftershave. Many women object to it, or they dislike a particular scent. Some women are even allergic to scents of any sort. Greet her by gently shaking hands. The key to success with an INFJ woman is a slow hand. Don’t overwhelm her with conversation. Let her take the lead and be a good listener. If there’s one thing women agree on, men in general tend to talk too much and listen too little. - Avoid bragging about yourself and your accomplishments. If you have a lot of money, don’t talk about it. If you drive an expensive car, downplay it in conversation. Open doors for her. Let her walk in front of you. It’s permissible to guide her by the elbow or a touch on the back. Make your moves easy and casual. At a restaurant, let the maître de or waitress guide you both to a table, with you following behind her. Let your date order first. If you think she’s protecting you from spending too much, say something like, “Please, order anything you like.” Then you should order something equally as expensive. She’s sensitive and will feel guilty if you don’t. Ask if she’d like a drink. If she says no, you should, too. If she says yes, order for yourself, too. In case you’re a nondrinker, just order a sparkling water. If she’s a little shy and not used to taking charge of a conversation, ask her some questions to show your interest, such as “Where did you grow up?” “How did you like it?” “Do you have any hobbies?” Maybe you’ll be lucky and she won’t need any prompting at all. Let her be the one to start eating. That’s the signal that you can begin, too. Leave the server a tip of 15 to 20 percent of the bill. Nothing embarrasses an INFJ woman more than a date who leaves no tip or an inadequate one. At a movie theatre, let her choose the seats. (“Where would you like to sit?”) A romantic movie or a tear-jerker often justifies holding hands. That’s fine, but let her make the first move, even though it’s a tentative one. If the movie by any chance makes you tear up, don’t be afraid to wipe your eyes so that she can see you’re moved. Now comes the tricky part. When you arrive back at her place, she may not ask you in. Who knows whether this is from shyness or not? If she doesn’t invite you in, simply say goodbye on the door step, holding her hands briefly and kissing her on the forehead, cheek or (lightly) mouth. Tell her what a good time you had, and you’d like to go out again. Then leave. Let’s say she invites you in. Take your cues from her—what she says, her body language, where she sits, etc. If it’s clear that she wants to prolong contact with you and is feeling romantic, follow her signals. Encourage her, but avoid being an obvious aggressor. The secret is to respond with sensitivity and gentleness, always encouraging further moves from her. You want to excite her, but not push her. Never leave her feeling she didn’t have a choice, that she was coerced into lovemaking. Be creative about foreplay, touching and kissing her hands, arms, neck, and face. Breathe gently into her ear. and whisper, “What are you doing to me?” If she starts removing her clothes, help her. Start removing yours—slowly. Whisper and talk to her. Tell her how beautiful she is, how much she turns you on, how hard it is to hold back. But do hold back. The variety of moves available to you both is almost endless from here on, but the trick is to always give her a bit less than she wants. Make her long for more. Eventually, you can give in, but not immediately. Remember the motto, “Ladies first.” However you do it, bring her to orgasm before you give in to yours. Then, when you come, express your pleasure and gratitude simply and quietly. After orgasm, prolong the “post-coital” release by sinking into each other arms. At this point, many men have the urge to get up and shower. Bad move! A woman’s need for “after-play” is almost always stronger than a man’s. If you want to continue your relationship with the woman, you should honor this need. If you’re not staying until morning, your parting should be prolonged and tender. While you’re putting your clothes back on, tell her how wonderful she was, how you want to see her again. Once you’re dressed, embrace her again. Kiss her. Tell her it’s goodbye, but not for long. Leave quietly, locking the door behind you. Assuming that you are still infatuated with this woman, send her a bouquet of flowers in the morning or just an email message. Keep the fire kindled! Remember that the steps applying to lovemaking apply all the time. Never should you give in to the temptation to rush things, unless the drive comes from your partner. The man with a slow hand always wins—at least with INFJ women.\n","date":"April 8, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/9785e2e91bbb36a2650cc3e5e7aa40f4_hu9a52c620de6c9dbd9bfed9fd0612abf2_63864_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/9785e2e91bbb36a2650cc3e5e7aa40f4_hu9a52c620de6c9dbd9bfed9fd0612abf2_63864_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/how-to-seduce-an-infj-woman/","title":"How To Seduce an INFJ Woman"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\rPeople of the INFJ and ENFJ Myers-Briggs types usually make compatible friends and partners. It makes sense when you look at their shared traits: intuition, feeling, and judging. The two types differ only in their tendencies toward introversion and extraversion, and that’s not all bad. The introverted INFJ is likely to encourage the ENFJ to spend time together so they can enjoy each other’s company in private. The ENFJ, in turn, promotes participation in social activities and group events. This is good for the INFJ, at least some of the time.\nFriendship Like ENFJs, INFJs have a sixth sense for the needs of others. As friends, they often work on projects that involve helping people. The difference between the two is that the INFJ isn’t as obvious or demonstrative. The interpersonal skills of ENFJs make others want to join them. The INFJ is there to back up the ENFJ’s efforts. ENFJs are quick to show their gratitude to friends and co-workers and are generally well liked. INFJs are more reserved. It takes effort for them to show their emotions.\nENFJs and INFJs enjoy activities that require teamwork, especially service work. INFJs do, too, but they’re not as outwardly enthusiastic and verbal. While ENFJs often find themselves pushed into leadership positions at work and in the community, INFJs are happy to let them have the spotlight. They’re satisfied to serve their ENFJ friends as consultants and collaborators.\nBoth INFJs and ENFJs have strong personalities, radiate authenticity, and rarely betray their ideals.\nBoth are skilled verbally, the INFJ more in writing than speaking. They have an eloquence that helps bring people together in a common cause. They enjoy working together. Romance When an INFJ and ENFJ are attracted to each other, it’s all they can think about. However, the ENFJ is usually the one to make the first overtures. INFJs are cautious and fearful of rejection. ENFJs bring gifts to the new partner, write e-mails, and arrange romantic evenings out. They like to talk about the relationship. INFJs are glad to hear the things that they, too, would like to say but are too shy to express.\nBeing idealists, both types tend to avoid acknowledging the normal ups and downs of a relationship. They may sweep problems under the rug when they should be handled openly. Resolving conflicts can clear the air. Both parties can learn new information that enables them to interact more meaningfully in the future.\nNeither the INFJ nor the ENFJ wants to hear anything negative about their partner from friends. Both are sure they’ve made the right choice and don’t want to be told otherwise.\nIf a partner cheats on them or breaks up the relationship, they suffer considerably.\nThey’re ashamed that things didn’t work out and feel that they’re somehow at fault. The split is likely to be more painful for INFJs than for ENFJs, who are more capable of moving on because of their outgoing nature. Family Life If an INFJ and ENFJ decide to build a home together, their family life is likely to be active and happy. They generally make considerate partners and parents. When they’ve brought work home from the office or have personal chores that need doing, they’re willing to put them on hold to meet the needs of their partners and children. As a result, the children may find it easy to impose on their parents. ENFJs, particularly, need to be careful about letting family members take advantage of their easy-going nature.\nBoth types spend a good deal of their spare time reading. They encourage their children to enjoy books, taking them to the library and often reading to them at bedtime. They like attending educational events as a family. On the way home from a movie or play, ENFJs are likely to engage the children in conversation about the plot and characters. It pleases them to encourage their children to observe the world intelligently. INFJs, being more introspective, enjoy the exchanges but may not have a great deal to contribute.\nIf family problems arise, the parents may avoid discussing them at first, due to their aversion to conflict.\nWhen things get serious enough—and the happiness and comfort of others are at stake— they will bring the family together to resolve the issues. Both are good at fostering a cooperative and amiable home environment.\nSecrets of Success While the INFJ and ENFJ have a lot in common, they should realize that their privacy needs differ and should be respected. The INFJ needs time alone to read, work at the computer, and putter around the house. Some INFJs need the freedom to take retreats by themselves. On the other hand, the ENFJ is an outgoing person who needs to participate in group activities. The INFJ should participate frequently to strengthen their bond.\n","date":"April 8, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/fa39a40881fa53092d049c8d9da657f2_hu1f1a47845670b74ccab3cff86c277b5c_45500_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/fa39a40881fa53092d049c8d9da657f2_hu1f1a47845670b74ccab3cff86c277b5c_45500_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/infj-meets-enfj/","title":"INFJ Meets ENFJ"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\rINFJs usually get along well with ENTPs. This may be surprising when one considers that they have only one Myers-Briggs trait in common—intuition (N).\nWith their tendency toward introversion (I), INFJs are reserved and shy. Extraverted (E) ENTPs are gregarious and outgoing. As a feeling type (F), INFJs base their decisions on emotional factors, mainly the impact their choices will have on others. More rational ENTPs, with their thinking (T) preference, make decisions based on hard facts, not feelings. Finally, INFJs with their judging (J) preference, like closure. Open-ended situations make them uneasy. Their goal is to bring matters to a conclusion. As perceivers (P), ENTPs are more happy-go-lucky. They often postpone decisions, barely skate under deadlines, and are late for appointments. If they weren’t so pleasant to be around, they might get on people’s nerves.\nINFJs can be counted on to finish a project once it’s started. They’re serious, determined workers.\nENTPs are more likely to jump from one challenge to another, leaving a good bit of work unfinished along the way. While both types get excited about thinking up new ventures, ENTPs tend to lose interest in old ones. Friendship\nBecause they share the intuitive (N) trait, both Myers-Briggs types are able to see the big picture, which is what motivates their creativity. This is the most powerful connection they have. No matter what setting they’re in, they have ideas about how to improve things. Often they’re almost clairvoyant about the future. They’re confident of their hunches, and usually rightly so. However, INFJs are more averse to taking risks with resources—their own and others’. When ENTPs win, they win big. When they lose, they lose big. Their lives are full of twist and turns. INFJs are more predictable in the courses their lives take.\nBoth INFJs and ENTPs are independent types. They need freedom to follow their own dreams. They have this characteristic in common and it strengthens their relationship if both have high self-esteem and insist on their autonomy as individuals.\nRomance\nIf an INFJ and ENTP meet and there’s a potential for attraction, it’s obvious to both of them pretty quickly. However, INFJs are reluctant to speak up first because of their natural reserve. ENTPs, on the other hand, are cautious for a different reason. With their rational approach to life, they’re conservative about commitments. On the ENTP’s side, platonic friendship often seems like a good option for a period of time. In contrast, once INFJs are sure of a commitment, their sensual nature urges them on to physical intimacy. If the ENTP isn’t ready for this, the relationship may die a natural death.\nIf the partnership continues but later falters, the ENTP, being the more rational of the two, may decide that the relationship isn’t up to his or her standard. Perhaps the more stable INFJ becomes boring after a while, causing the ENTP to feel tied down. When this happens, ENTPs usually try to find a diplomatic way out that won’t distress the partner too much. If the relationship ends, the INFJ may be devastated. On the other hand, the ENTP is likely to put his or her inventive brain to work figuring out why it was destined to fail anyhow. When an INFJ partner calls it quits, the ENTP partner uses the same rationalization and recovers relatively quickly.\nINFJs who rely on financial security may find living with an ENTP chaotic. At some time or another, most ENTPs find themselves on shaky financial footing. An ENTP partnership may not suit the INFJ who enjoys a quiet, predictable life.\nHome Life\nAs partners in life, INFJ/ENTP couples are likely to have homes jammed with books, gadgets, musical instruments, and hobby supplies. They encourage their children to use them all, especially for learning. Neatness and schedules are likely to be ignored in the scramble for pleasure and challenges. ENTP parents, particularly, offer their children more ideas of things to do than they can possibly manage. The ENTP parent can be counted on for nonstop fun and excitement. The kids may rely on the INFJ parent more for quiet expressions of love and relaxing down time.\nENTPs are more enthusiastic about family celebrations than their reserved INFJ partners. However, it’s often the INFJ who sees that the preparations are done on time and the party starts on schedule. Then the ENTP arrives full of energy and ready to turn on the charm. If the party gets overheated, the ENTP’s behavior is not always appropriate. Sometimes ENTPs pick arguments just for the fun of debating. Less competitive INFJs seldom take pleasure in these exchanges and may feel hurt or annoyed.\nWhen home projects aren’t going the way ENTPs think they should, they are clever at persuading their partners of their point of view and talking them into their solutions. Because they’re so persuasive, they can be manipulative and take advantage of other, less quick-thinking family members.\nSecrets of Success\nENTPs who can pause in their hectic pursuits to reflect and spend time in the quiet company of their INFJ partners are likely to calm down. INFJs can encourage them to enjoy intimate exchanges more than they’re accustomed to. Both are likely to benefit from traveling as a couple.\nThey’ll be exposed to challenges and opportunities that stimulate them and, at the same time, deepen the intimacy of their relationship.

These Myers-Briggs types are exact opposites. The INFJ (I) is introverted—a private person. The ESTP (E) is sociable and outgoing. INFJs rely more on intuition (N) than concrete facts to reach conclusions. ESTPs use their sensing (S) function to get information from the immediate environment. INFJs take action based on their feeling (F) function, evaluating the impact of their decisions on others. ESTPs pride themselves on their ability to reach decisions based on logic (T). Finally, INFJs like to bring closure to situations, a judging (J) function. ESTPs like to keep decisions open-ended.\nThey’re happy-go-lucky about appointment times and deadlines—unlike INFJs, who arrive places on time and meet their deadlines. If it’s true that opposites attract, that surely must be the case for INFJs and ESTPs. Friendship\nIntroverted (I) INFJs approach friendship in a quiet, thoughtful way. They are comfortable alone or with one or two close friends. ESTPs can be found wherever the action is.\nWhile both types have a sense of humor, INFJs lean toward subtle, dry wit whereas ESTPs paint their humor in broad strokes. Some INFJs find the bluff approach of ESTPs a bit much. ESTPs often find INFJs a little boring. Both types like to laugh, but they find their humor in different places.\nThe intuitive (N) INFJ observes what’s going on—requiring a limited amount of concrete information to guess where events are headed and determine what decisions to make. INFJs rely on hunches. And they’re usually on target. They’re more interested in the meaning of events than in the events themselves. Sensing (S) ESTPs wonder how their INFJ friends can jump to conclusions based on so little evidence. It seems crazy to them. The fact that the INFJ is often right is an unexplainable mystery.\nRomance\nINFJs are big on romance and physical intimacy. Their introversion, intuition and feeling traits set them up for it. For ESTPs, love has less to do with intimacy than it does with finding a fun partner with whom to share life’s adventures.\nWhile the INFJ is cautious in the first stages of a relationship due to fear of rejection, the ESTP is the opposite. Winning an exciting partner is a challenge—in fact, it’s one of the main objects of romance. Because ESTPs would rather make romantic moves on the ski slopes than in the bedroom, the INFJ can get disappointed in the relationship. ESTPs are generally not creative or passionate lovers.\nUnlike most INFJs, ESTPs are risk takers, whether the risks are physical, financial or intellectual. They’re willing to play for high stakes in the hope of high rewards. They especially enjoy looking for loopholes or unusual pay-offs relative to the time or money invested.\nTo the INFJ, this is foolhardy. The pipe dreams of the ESTP seem risky to the INFJ and frequently the product of poor judgment. In a partnership, this can cause trouble over time. ESTPs tend to lay themselves open to con schemes. INFJs are usually too intuitive to fall for them. The question is, can an INFJ get an ESTP partner to listen?\nWhen a partner ends a relationship, it’s a bitter pill for the INFJ to swallow. In contrast, an abandoned ESTP will be unhappy for a while but soon decide that life is too short for grief and sadness. ESTPs know how to cut their losses and face new challenges.\nFamily Life\nINFJs are enjoyable to live with, offering the family intimacy as well as intellectual stimulation. ESTPs are fun to live with, too, but for different reasons. Their spontaneity keeps things lively and their practical orientation to life makes sure that things get done.\nWhile INFJs have no trouble taking action when it’s appropriate, they do think before jumping in. ESTPs are more likely to fly by the seat of their pants. If the family dog escapes from the yard and runs off, the ESTP is in the car immediately, patrolling the neighborhood and calling the dog’s name. “Bruno! Bruno! Where are you?” The INFJ, thinking before acting, recalls that Bruno has a doggie friend one block away. Acting on a hunch, he or she calls the neighbor. Sure enough, Bruno is scratching at the chain link fence where his friend stands waiting, tail wagging. ESTPs know how to anticipate the needs of partners and children when it suits them. Occasionally, though, they’re so direct that feelings are hurt when they overlook ordinary courtesies. INFJs may have to overcome their conflict-avoidant style to point this out to the ESTP for the good of everyone involved.\nAs parents, INFJs and ESTPs work in harmony. Both have realistic expectations of their children. They don’t need to see straight A’s when report cards come home as long as the children are applying themselves and working toward goals that are productive and make them happy.\nINFJs aren’t the tidiest people in the world, but they’re better than ESTPs, who tend to live in cluttered home environments. That’s because ESTPs have so much going on at once—much of it requiring supplies and equipment. However, they may keep certain areas of the house organized enough that they can find the right thing when it’s needed. The parts of their home that are orderly usually relate to their hobbies or special interests.\nESTPs often try to talk family members into risk-taking sports such as hang-gliding, white-water rafting, or downhill skiing. They tire of safe domestic routines. Attacking the unpredictable gives them a rush. INFJs aren’t as adventurous and may balk at the suggestion of sports that threaten life and limb.\nSecrets of Success\nAn important bond for the INFJ/ESTP couple is the love they share for children, close relatives, friends, and even pets. They may have different perspectives on the world, but at least they share the rose-colored glasses of affection.\nIn the intimacy of their partnership, they should realize that a little give and take is in order.\nINFJs do well to expand their social activities with ESTPs, spending time as a couple with friends and relatives. ESTPs need to pay attention to the emotional needs of the INFJs, at least some of the time.

They have rich inner lives and treasure their solitude. Also, their intuition is highly developed, giving them the ability to see what’s going on under the surface. They understand why people do the things they do. Because they see through facades and games, deceivers and players can seldom fool them for long. INFPs and INFJs examine every piece of evidence for its fundamental truth and then seek the wider context into which it fits.\nAs idealists, both types drive themselves to achieve their goals, which are frequently humanitarian. If they don’t have the luxury of choosing careers that meet their needs, they spend much of their spare time helping others. Their values are strong and their principles firm—unless they find a valid reason to change them. Their biggest question is, “What’s my purpose?”\nINFPs and INFJs set such high standards for themselves that they’re often disappointed in the results of their work. Because they don’t give themselves enough credit, they make good partners. Each supports and encourages the other.\nThey protect their privacy. When they’re not allowed enough time alone, they feel drained. They need solitude to recharge their batteries and get their energy back. As friends and partners, they understand this and are usually generous about giving each other space. Both are somewhat prone to depression. Their introversion inclines them to be loners, giving them the tendency to brood over problems without checking the facts with others. Their feeling preference inclines them to exaggerate the importance of conflicts or hurt feelings.\nBoth types are generally well liked due to their warmth and sincerity. They make good listeners, put others at ease, and are valued as friends and confidantes.\nIntuition (N)\nThe intuitive skills shared by the INFP and INFJ form their strongest bond. They usually agree on important matters. Due to differences in their perceiving and judging functions, however, they don’t always carry out practical tasks in the same way. The INFP may start a painting project, then leave it half-finished—intending to finish at a more convenient time. INFJs aren’t happy until the job is complete.\nAs intuitive individuals, they sift through their experiences to discover their meaning. How does the evidence fit into the big picture? People with a sensing preference, whose intuition is less developed, tend to accept things at surface value. They see no point in overthinking matters. As a result, they may fail to appreciate the insights and predictions of INFPs and INFJs—sometimes at their peril.\nWork\nINFPs and INFJs frequently find careers in fields requiring verbal skills. They cooperate and communicate effectively with others. Often they hold medical or social service jobs. Their sharp intuition helps them solve problems, their feeling function encourages people to trust them, and their introversion gives them time to contemplate the complex factors in situations. They prefer careers that don’t emphasize details but focus on patterns.\nCounseling and mental health therapy are common careers among INFPs. INFJs do this work, too, but they can be less patient with clients’ progress. Because of their judging function, they often make the best writers. They use their verbal skills to build constructs, put them on paper, and get them published.\nWhile both types get along with others, group projects frustrate them. They get annoyed by co-workers who don’t live up to their standards or fail to see the big picture. They generally remain polite, but inside they may be seething. When an INFP and INFJ collaborate on projects, they may have conflicts over deadlines as the former dawdles and the latter pushes to finish on time.\nTaking on too much to please others is a problem they have in common. Also, they may give colleagues the impression that they agree on the details of a project when in fact they do not. They need to assert themselves more and learn to be honest, giving negative feedback when it’s important. They need to make sure their own needs are met, too—asking for a raise, for example, when it’s deserved.\nINFPs make effective mediators in the workplace—especially in situations where they have no self-interest. They are less likely to take sides than INFJs. They want to hear everything. INFJs can draw conclusions too quickly.\nRomance\nWhen INFPs fall in love with INFJs, the natural reserve of the former makes it hard for them to express their affection in words. It’s a little easier for the INFJ, who can also be shy but is better at taking action. Both can be eloquent in their physical expressions of love. As lovers, they are tender and creative. This helps keep the relationship anchored.\nThe two types are sensitive and easily hurt. One or the other can easily misinterpret a casual statement, offhand action, or forgotten promise and feel rejected. When one says, “I’ll be late tonight” as he or she leaves the house and means nothing more than that, the other may give the statement a sinister interpretation.\nTo avoid bruised egos, they need to remember the importance of frequent reality checks.\nBoth tend to overdramatize situations and ignore the simple facts. When a disagreement comes up, they can get out of touch with each other. They have to release their ego investment and back-pedal in order to find common ground.\nThey tend to be absent-minded, too, which can be annoying for everyone. Where are the house keys? Did anyone let the cat in this morning? What time were we supposed to be there? Both are likely to shrug and say they don’t know.\nFortunately, they’re tolerant of each other because they share the inability to recall the concrete details of life. Such mundane matters don’t hold their attention.\nFamily Life\nAs parents, both types listen attentively to each other and their children, although INFJs are slightly less patient because of their judging function. They’re more likely to interrupt a conversation to see where it’s going. The INFP is content to listen without closure. INFPs wait to think about what’s been said before deciding what to do.\nThey avoid conflicts. Under normal conditions, they’re courteous and respectful, seldom raising their voices. When a problem comes up, they talk it over. The difference is that INFJs have a stronger need to decide who’s right and who’s wrong, while the INFP’s main goal is to preserve good will in the family. Both get rattled by conflict, but the INFJ is more likely to stand his or her ground on critical issues.\nWhen it’s time for a vacation, INFJ parents are generally the chief planners. Their inclination to arrange details before checking them out with the family can cause problems, but after they’ve set off, the parents have no problem giving everyone time alone. After all, they want that, too. When the family re-gathers, they relax and have fun.\nNurturing their children comes naturally to INFPs and INFJs. They are patient, devoted, and protective parents. However, when friction arises over, say, a child’s behavior, they tend to keep their objections to themselves longer than they should. Eventually the INFJ in particular is likely to blow up.\nFamous INFPs and INFJs\nINFPs and INFJs whose four Myers-Briggs functions are healthy and well developed can accomplish great things, although they are generally humble about them.\nAbraham Lincoln was an INFP—moody, quiet, gentle, witty and determined. As his law partner described him: “He cared little for simple facts. He cared for the underlying principle of truth and justice.” Other famous INFPs include J.R.R. Tolkien, Virginia Woolf, Vincent van Gogh, and John Lennon.\nThomas Jefferson was an INFJ. A historian described Jefferson’s character as having “a too-good-for-this-world streak that showed itself in many ways, from his mountaintop house, to his dislike of face-to-face argument.” Other famous INFJs include Carl Jung, Mahatma Gandhi, Agatha Christy, Leonard Trotsky, and Michelle Pfeiffer.\n","date":"April 8, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/6194c1a868ff69c9006cb451c4660437_hu56ed1f1749637a486c810e97049c1ead_120641_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/6194c1a868ff69c9006cb451c4660437_hu56ed1f1749637a486c810e97049c1ead_120641_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/infj-meets-infp/","title":"INFJ Meets INFP"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\rEach of the sixteen Myers-Briggs types is unique and different. Some types are outgoing and gregarious, while others treasure their privacy. Some are serious and others are fun-loving. Some are warm and giving and others are cool-headed and objective. A few of the types have similar descriptions. That’s because they have several traits in common. For example, the INFP is much like the INFJ because each is introverted (I), intuitive (N), and Feeling (F). They differ only in the Perceiving vs. Judging traits.\nWhen under stress, each type has the tendency to overuse its strengths to the point where they sabotage their ability to cope. An example is the Introverted type. The person tends to withdraw when stressed out, avoiding the company of others. When this trait is carried to the extreme, the person becomes isolated and no longer enjoys feedback and support.\nThe Eight Introverted Types\nISTJ\nFor ISTJs, one way of losing out is to immerse themselves in too much detail. They may become so fixated on rules and minute details that they forget the overall meaning of an activity. A mother supervising a child’s birthday party may be so obsessed with a game and its rules that she forgets the purpose of the game—to have fun. In this way, she only communicates her stress to the children and no one has a good time. By focusing on the details of the game, she forgets the larger issue: fun.\nIn their effort to get the job done, ISTJs may overlook such niceties as “please” and “thank you.” By neglecting to make direct personal comments, they fail to show their appreciation to others.\nUnder stress, ISTJs may ignore the long-term implications of a project in favor of day-to-day realities. Because of their tendency to focus on short-term goals, they may lose sight of the overall purpose of their work. They rely too much on the standard way of doing things and neglect innovation, which is sometimes critical in this changing world. They also see errors more readily than successes, resulting in a doom-and-gloom attitude toward work.\nISTJs sometimes have difficulty recognizing their own emotions and values. As a result, they may be seen as insensitive and cold. As the stress from work situations heightens, so does the likelihood that ISTJs will explode, doing no one much good. ISTP\nLike all Myers-Briggs types, ISTPs under stress act in ways that depart from their usual style.\nOne of their problems is finding shortcuts when a project seems too long and difficult. By taking the easy way out, they can jeopardize successful completion, which makes them appear indifferent and unmotivated. When working on parts of a project that they enjoy, their work is usually competent and satisfactory. It’s the parts that frustrate or bore them that get them in trouble. If a homeowner is cultivating both a vegetable and flower garden behind the house, weeding the vegetable patmay be a much less gratifying job than tending the flowers. Later in the summer the family complains that they have fewer fresh vegetables than they expected, although the flower garden is lovely.\nISTPs may lose out when they keep important information to themselves, failing to inform others. When they do share they may focus on the faults and problems of the issue in question. As a result, others find themselves operating on incomplete information.\nBecause ISTPs are oriented to collecting new facts, they can get overwhelmed by all the information they have dug up. As a result, they may put off decision-making in order to keep their options open. This may give them the appearance of being indecisive and incompetent.\nFinally, ISTPs may find themselves in trouble when they fail to complete old projects and instead move on to new ones. They sometimes have difficulty with perseverance and the ability to stay with undertakings until they have finished them. A boy who makes model airplanes loves having the final products but leaves many of the planes unfinished because the work gets too complex. His parents are disappointed that they’ve paid for so many kits and their son has so few completed airplanes to show.\nISFJ\nOne way ISFJs can lose out is by paying too much attention to the present status of problems and failing to seek options for a satisfactory solution. They can see the present clearly but not the possibilities for the future. Thus, they may get stuck in ruts and unable to find a way out. They focus on past negative experiences and apply them to the present problem. If, for example, the car is making a strange noise, they may remember a time when they threw a rod on an old automobile and assume that the same disastrous breakdown is about the occur, when actually a broken fan belt may be the only problem.\nISFJs attend to plan excessively. They want things to go a certain way and become discouraged if they turn out to be wrong. If things proceed satisfactorily, they may waste time looking for another potential problem. For example, they may get to an outdoor concert an hour in advance to find a good seat, and then, while they are waiting, worry about the chances of rain.\nISFJs may feel undervalued by others as a result of their quiet, self-effacing style. This may cause them to lose confidence when presenting their ideas in a group. They tend to minimize their own importance and contributions to an organization, so that everyone takes them for granted. They view their contributions as simply “doing their duty.” An employee presenting the progress of his project before a committee may minimizing her own contribution so no one realizes that she was instrumental in its success.\nISFP\nIn times of stress, ISFPs may overlook their own needs. Because they see others’ needs so clearly and they’re motivated to serve them, they may ignore their own requirements.\nWhen a loved one is in the hospital with a serious condition, the ISFP is likely to put all his or her concerns aside in favor of staying with the loved one, keeping the spirits up of the rest of the family, and so on. If the hospitalization lasts long enough, the ISFP may get worn down and lose his or her positive attitude—becoming snappish and unhelpful.\nConflict is disagreeable to ISFPs and they try to avoid it at all costs. If they do engage in a confrontation, they may later feel like the disagreement was their fault. Even if the issues legitimately belong to the other party, they may feel hurt and withdraw rather than confront the person and “clear the air.”\nISFPs tend to accept the statements and opinions of others as valid. They are often gullible. Strong, manipulative, persuasive people may find them easy prey. Rather than buy into the views of others without question, ISFPs need to develop a more skeptical attitude and ways to analyze the words and actions of others more realistically.\nFailing to appreciate their own contributions and accomplishments is another way ISFPs can lose out under stress. Because they are gentle types who focus internally, they suffer from self-criticism—which may not be apparent to the outside world. Without outside support from trusted friends and coworkers, their thoughts become negative and destructive. They need to appreciate their contributions more, although this may be difficult given their habitual modesty.\nINFJ\nUnder stress, INFJs can lose contact with some of the unpleasant realities of life. They focus mainly on their idealist vision of how things should be, ignoring reality when it contradicts their views. Because of their single-minded, persistent view of how things should be, they don’t know when to cut their losses and move on. They may need help from supportive friends and coworkers in learning how to relax and let go of futile dreams.\nAnother way INFJs lose out is when they fail to act assertively and don’t share important ideas and insights with others. Because of their reluctance to intrude, many of their ideas are overlooked or underestimated. People who might have been able to support them have their hands tied because they were never included in the INFJ’s thinking process.\nAnother way INFJs can lose out is by focusing on facts that aren’t relevant to the situation at hand. They need to focus on which details are important and which aren’t. A female INFJ getting the house ready for a big party might find herself obsessing over everything. If, for example, she can’t find her embroidered guest towels she may enter a state of “melt down” until someone points out to her that no one ever uses them anyhow. The stress of her big party has made her temporarily unreasonable, prey to her drive for perfection.\nINFJs hold their criticisms inside longer than they should because of their belief in the old saying, “If you can’t say something nice, don’t say anything at all.” When the pressure mounts and their objections are stifled long enough, they can blow up. Trusted colleagues can help them focus on the overall concept in question and retreat from an attitude of blaming to one of acceptance and understanding.\nINFP\nOne way that INFPs can lose out when under stress is by focusing on their dreams so intently that they’re blind to others’ points of view. They fail to adjust their unrealistic vision to the facts of reality. If they’re extremely out of touch, people might view them as almost mystical. An INFP who believe he has the solution to world problems can be brought back to Earth by questions regarding individual actions that can contribute to the goal.\nAnother problem for the INFP under stress is that they try to please too many people at once. They never refuse any one, with the result that they’re often overtaxed, sometimes to the point of being resentful. They also dislike conflict and will go to some lengths to avoid it. It’s not uncommon for them to give people the impression that they agree about an issue, when actually they are dead set against it. They need to get more tough-minded and assertive, learning how to give negative feedback tactfully but firmly.\nINFPs may delay finishing projects because they’re holding out for a perfection that simply isn’t possible. They postpone action by focusing inward instead of reaching for resources outside themselves. Outside support can encourage them but also give realistic feedback concerning a project. Nothing has to be perfect. Something to start with is better than nothing at all. An employee preparing a brochure for his company may try to do the proofreading, graphics and layout to perfection when there are other professionals available to do these jobs. As a result, the project may be late, much to the annoyance of his supervisors.\nFinally, INFPs, although generally modest and gentle, can become overly critical about everything that bothers them. Everyone around them seems irresponsible and incompetent, as the result of the INFPs internal feelings of stress. They lose the ability to see the situation logically, step back, and let their natural appreciation come forward. A man throwing a party for his business associates may find himself criticizing what his wife is wearing, how the table is set, the noise the children are making, and other bothersome details when the real culprit is his own anxiety.\nINTJ\nSome INTJs have trouble letting go of their expectations when they aren’t based on facts or current reality. They imagine they have the ability to predict the future—when they don’t. Their impractical ideas and goals may be so impractical that the INTJs seem to be living in a dream. Sometimes they’re so private about their vision that they fail to communicate with other people who will be affected by it or are necessary to make it happen. They need to learn when to give up on unrealistic dreams and solicit the input of others to help get them back on track.\nAn employee planning a going-away party for a co-worker may try doing everything herself—the announcements, music, refreshments, etc.—instead of enlisting the help of others in the company who have the expertise she needs. As a result, the party may come off as a half-finished affair.\nSome INTJs have a certain model or way of living that they approve of and then criticize those who don’t fit the model. For example, people who are Democrats may be so fixated on their line of thinking that they can hardly make themselves speak to a Republican. They find it difficult to tolerate choices that don’t conform to their own. They need to filter out the single characteristic that offends them and focus on the person’s general merit, of which they may actually approve.\nINTJs can also lose out by focusing on unimportant details. Their need to control all possible outcomes prevents them from attending to what’s really necessary. If they have bought their son a new suit to wear for special family events, they may not be satisfied until the pants are lengthened (or shortened) one quarter of an inch and they’ve found the perfect tie to go with the suit. The son could care less about a suit he doesn’t want to wear anyhow, so his parents’ perfectionism is wasted. They could have spared themselves the nagging over the issue of the dress suit.\nINTJs may ignore the impact of their style on others. With their impersonal, independent approach to life, they think that others function best in the same kind of environment. Others may see them as detached, inflexible and logical—so much so that they’re afraid to approach the INTJ. When they find out that their style is alienating others, many are surprised. They need to learn to foster their relationships and make sure they show appreciation others.\nINTPs\nBecause of their tendency to focus on the shortcomings of others, INTPs may be perceived as negative and arrogant. They may appear to be aloof and fault-finding and are surprised when they’re not liked by others.\nThe man whose spouse has just come home with a new dress and is asked his opinion may say something like, “It’s all right but I think the hemline is a little high.” He may have made this remark with the best of intentions, wanting only to be helpful, but his partner thinks he finds nothing attractive about the dress (because he didn’t say so) or he objects to her showing so much leg. She takes his comment personally and feels criticized and unappreciated.\nAnother way the INTP can lose out if by focusing on the small inconsistencies in a project or plan. They may even prevent the project from moving forward because they stall progressing one small step. They need to learn when to let go of trivial details that are of little consequence. To others, this tendency may lead them to believe that the INTP suffers from convoluted opinions outside the understanding of ordinary people. A woman preparing wedding invitations for her daughter may become so focused on the font used in the announcement none of the printer’s efforts please her. As a result, the project is late and the guests have very short notice.\nINTPs can be their own worst critics as they hamstring themselves looking for the exact way to present their ideas perfectly. They can’t listen to praise because they know they could have done so much better. Focusing on their own flaws without outside support can even end up making them depressed. They need to discuss their feelings with other people who can provide more realistic, candid opinion.\nBecause INTPs are usually so conservative and quiet, their emotions—the least accessible part of themselves—can stay bottled up until the pressure is too great. Then they may explode in an unmanageable outburst and appear hypersensitive. Bystanders can be so overwhelmed by this unexpected display of feelings that they come to regard the INTP as unstable.\nINTPs are especially susceptible when they can’t identify an objective cause for their emotions, which shouldn’t be disregarded simply because they seem illogical. Exploration of the emotions with a trusted supporter can pave the way to potential areas for growth.\nWhen these introverts get back on track, they can be enjoyable to work and live with and tireless in following through on their commitments. By keeping their Myers-Briggs traits in a healthy balance, they can make the best of their work, leisure, and relationships.\n","date":"April 8, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/fe6d4900d995b0c65ee06cff2f1de625_hu26a7be63acf295417eb9d8b0c8376ddd_34304_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/fe6d4900d995b0c65ee06cff2f1de625_hu26a7be63acf295417eb9d8b0c8376ddd_34304_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/introverts-at-risk/","title":"Introverts at Risk"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\rINFP and INFJ types are alike in many ways. Both types are introverted (I), intuitive (N), and feeling (F). They have rich inner lives and treasure their solitude. Their intuition is highly developed, giving them the ability to see what’s going on under the surface. They understand why people do the things they do. Because they see through facades and games, deceivers and players can seldom fool them for long. INFPs and INFJs examine every piece of evidence for its fundamental truth and then seek the wider context into which it fits.\nAs idealists, both types drive themselves to achieve their goals, which are frequently humanitarian. If they don’t have the luxury of choosing careers that meet their needs, they spend much of their spare time helping others. Their values are strong and their principles firm—unless they find a valid reason to change them. Their biggest question is, “What’s my purpose?” This quest helps them form a close bond together.\nINFPs and INFJs set such high standards for themselves that they’re often disappointed in the results of their work. Because they don’t give themselves enough credit, they need each other’s support. One encourages the other.\nThey protect their privacy. When they’re not allowed enough time alone, they feel drained. They need solitude to recharge their batteries and get their energy back. As friends and partners, they understand this and are usually generous about giving each other space.\nBoth are somewhat prone to depression. Their introversion inclines them to be loners, giving them the tendency to brood over problems without checking the facts with others. Their feeling preference inclines them to exaggerate the importance of conflicts or hurt feelings.\nBoth types are generally well liked due to their warmth and sincerity. They make good listeners, put others at ease, and are valued as friends and confidantes. Friendship The intuitive skills shared by the INFP and INFJ form their strongest bond. They usually agree on important matters. Due to differences in their perceiving and judging functions, however, they don’t always carry out practical tasks in the same way. The INFP may start a painting project, then leave it half-finished—intending to finish at a more convenient time. INFJs aren’t happy until the job is complete.\nAs intuitive individuals, they sift through their experiences to discover their meaning. How does the evidence fit into the big picture? People with a sensing preference, whose intuition is less developed, tend to accept things at surface value. They see no point in overthinking matters. As a result, they may fail to appreciate the insights and predictions of INFPs and INFJs—sometimes at their peril.\nINFPs and INFJs frequently have compatible careers requiring verbal skills. They cooperate and communicate effectively with others. Often they hold medical or social service jobs. Their sharp intuition helps them solve problems, their feeling function encourages people to trust them, and their introversion gives them time to contemplate the complex factors in situations. They prefer careers that don’t emphasize details but focus on patterns. These similarities give them a lot in common as friends.\nWhile both types get along with others, group projects frustrate them. They get annoyed by people who don’t live up to their standards or fail to see the big picture. They generally remain polite, but inside they may be seething. When an INFP and INFJ collaborate on projects, they may have conflicts over deadlines as the former dawdles while the latter pushes to finish on time.\nTaking on too much to please others is a problem they have in common. Also, they may give others the impression that they agree on the details of a project when in fact they do not. This is true of them as friends as well as participants in the larger community. They need to assert themselves more and learn to be honest, giving negative feedback when it’s important.\nRomance When INFPs fall in love with INFJs, the natural reserve of the former makes it hard for them to express their affection in words. It’s a little easier for the INFJ, who can also be shy but is better at taking action.\nBoth can be eloquent in their physical expressions of love. As lovers, they are tender and creative. This helps keep the relationship anchored. The two types are sensitive and easily hurt. One or the other can easily misinterpret a casual statement, offhand action, or forgotten promise and feel rejected. When one says, “I’ll be late tonight” as he or she leaves the house and means nothing more than that, the other may give the statement a sinister interpretation. To avoid bruised egos, they need to remember the importance of frequent reality checks.\nBoth tend to overdramatize situations and ignore the simple facts. When a disagreement comes up, they can get out of touch with each other. They have to release their ego investment and back-pedal in order to find common ground.\nThey tend to be absent-minded, too, which can be annoying for everyone. Where are the house keys? Did anyone let the cat in this morning? What time were we supposed to be there? Both are likely to shrug and say they don’t know.\nFortunately, they’re tolerant of each other because they share the inability to recall the concrete details of life. Such mundane matters don’t hold their attention.\nHome Life As parents, both types listen attentively to each other and their children, although INFJs are slightly less patient because of their judging function. They’re more likely to interrupt a conversation to see where it’s going. The INFP is content to listen without closure. INFPs wait to think about what’s been said before deciding what to do.\nThey avoid conflicts. Under normal conditions, they’re courteous and respectful, seldom raising their voices. When a problem comes up, they talk it over. The difference is that INFJs have a stronger need to decide who’s right and who’s wrong, while the INFP’s main goal is to preserve good will in the family. Both get rattled by conflict, but the INFJ is more likely to stand his or her ground on critical issues.\nWhen it’s time for a vacation, INFJ parents are generally the chief planners. Their inclination to arrange details before checking them out with the family can cause problems, but after they’ve set off, the parents have no problem giving everyone time alone. After all, they want that, too. When the family re-gathers, they relax and have fun.\nNurturing their children comes naturally to INFPs and INFJs. They are patient, devoted, and protective parents. However, when friction arises over, say, a child’s behavior, they tend to keep their objections to themselves longer than they should. Eventually the INFJ in particular is likely to blow up.\nSecrets of Success INFPs and INFJs whose four Myers-Briggs functions are healthy and well developed can accomplish great things, although they are generally humble about them. Respect for personal boundaries is an important key to success for the INFJ/INFP couple. Each has strong needs for privacy along with their need for mutual support.\n","date":"April 8, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/b1314b6cdf5f8ef3b5fb064c66cce1dd_hu51294406298e23bbd1c7a547f3db4211_62911_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/b1314b6cdf5f8ef3b5fb064c66cce1dd_hu51294406298e23bbd1c7a547f3db4211_62911_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/is-romance-in-the-air-infj-meets-infp/","title":"Is Romance in the Air?  INFJ Meets INFP"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\rMyers-Briggs personality traits have a lot to do with the potential for romance, friendship, and working relationships. They’re important in family life, too. Romance has a better chance of lasting between lovers of similar Myers-Briggs types. Siblings of the same personality type are likely to get along better than those of very different types.\nPeople of the Myers-Briggs INFJ personality type share some characteristics with the ENFP type, but not others. They differ in their sociability (I = introvert, E = extravert), but share their preferences for both intuition (I) and feeling (F)—the main reason for their attraction to each other. Both types have an uncanny ability to size people up as the result of their intuitive gifts. The difference is that the INFJ is less likely to share discoveries and insights unless prompted. Because of their shared feeling preference, both are kind, compassionate. Their differences in Perceiving (P) and Judging (J) explain why they go about tasks differently—the perceiving type being more easy-going and less driven than the punctual, conscientious judging type.\nLife is fun with ENFPs, who never tire of developing new interests. They’re at their best in situations that are fluid and changing. Even in their day-to-day activities they look for new ways of doing things.\nThe same is true of INFJs except that they are drawn to activities that involve fewer social contacts and less communication with others. INFJs are more private. Friendship\nINFJs and ENFPs can spend long hours talking and laughing together because their ways of thinking are similar. Their intuitive and feeling traits are the glue that holds the friendship together. However, they are often at odds about their differences in sociability. The INFJ may grow weary of the amount of time the ENFP spends in the company of others. He or she regrets that the ENFP doesn’t take more pleasure in their time alone as friends.\nIn healthy friendships, compromise is the key. If the ENFP accepts many party invitations, the INFJ can consent to attend some but bow out of others. Each friend needs to understand the character of the other, honor his or her preferences, and adapt some of the time.\nAnother difference between them concerns punctuality. The INFJ is rarely tardy and gets things done when promised. ENFPs have a tendency to be late. They lose track of time, because they underestimate how long it will take to finish what they’re doing. They miss deadlines or are slow in meeting their commitments. This happy-go-lucky attitude often annoys INFJs, who think it irresponsible. ENFPs, on the other hand, may consider INFJs clock-watchers.\nRomance\nENFPs have such appealing personalities that they’re never short of admirers. When a relationship takes hold with an INFJ, the bond is likely to be intense at first, as the ENFP showers attention on the other person. The INFJ feels honored and unconditionally loved. However, many of these relationships wear out over time, and the ENFP begins looking for another conquest.\nBeing in love is an almost constant state for ENFPs. When the love bug gets them, they study all aspects of the new partner. ENFPs tend to idealize their current relationships, thinking that the latest one is the best of all.\nWhether male or female, ENFPs can be seductive. They know how to appeal to attractive prospects and make themselves desirable. Sometimes they go too far in their quest for affection, making the INFJ feel pressured and deprived of private time. If this makes the INFJ uneasy, the ENFP is likely to get anxious and needy. A discussion about the importance of boundaries may help ease the ENFP’s jittery response to a partner’s hesitance.\nBeing abandoned by an ENFP partner is hard on the sensitive INFJ, who thinks, “I’ll never find a person this wonderful again.” In contrast, a rejected ENFJ usually smarts at first, but then recovers by exaggerating the partner’s shortcomings and concentrating on new prospects. When ENFPs are left by a lover, they rebound quickly.\nHome Life\nINFJs who marry ENFPs find that they’re enjoyable to live with. They also make good parents. They know how to turn family chores into enjoyable activities. If there’s a task that’s boring, they find a way to make it interesting. They infuse family life with creativity and avoid letting their home get too structured, with no room for imagination. When the freewheeling goes too far, however, the INFJ may complain that things are getting out of control.\nENFPs may consider themselves organized in their home life, but INFJ partners often take a different view. The ENFPs’ desire to be open to new possibilities is usually stronger than their need to keep things neat and tidy. When they fix meals, the kitchen is likely to be a mess. Their offices or dens are cluttered. There’s always something more interesting to do than clean up.\nBecause of their wide-ranging interests, ENFPs tend to change jobs often—even career tracks—with the result that their finances are shaky. Partly this is due to their success at landing jobs for which they’re not fully qualified. If the family needs a steady income, the tendency of ENFPs to quit jobs or get fired may frustrate INFJs.\nSecrets of Success\nINFJs and ENFPs share the gifts of compassion and desire to help others. They’re champions of good causes—whether their efforts are directed at people, animals, or the environment. By cooperating in their efforts to help others, they strengthen their own personal bond. They make good partners, and together they are an admirable team.\n","date":"April 8, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/bbe286ad8d399573420e8d0be080fa2a_hu96d684420d7241135c1e218622e59ca6_40646_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/bbe286ad8d399573420e8d0be080fa2a_hu96d684420d7241135c1e218622e59ca6_40646_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/is-romance-in-the-air-infj-meets-enfp/","title":"Is Romance in the Air?

INFJs are kind, generous, and helpful to others. When friends or even strangers are in trouble, INFJs hurry to the rescue. They’re ready to offer creative solutions or hands-on support.\nAs friends or partners, each can depend on the other to behave with integrity—whatever the setting. Their actions match their ideals. While they don’t make a fuss about their standard of ethics, it’s apparent in everything they do.\nDespite their admiration for each other, they are shy about giving and receiving praise due to their introverted personalities. They try to avoid the spotlight, even with one other person. Small talk is not their forte. They’d rather be quiet than engage in trivial conversation. In general, INFJs are at their best concentrating on their ideas and inspirations—not engaging in social banter.\nFriendship\nINFJs usually forge lasting friendships when they’re lucky enough to find each other. As friends, they work together harmoniously and are persistent about meeting their shared goals. If they meet resistance from outside sources, they only get more determined. Their friends and acquaintances respect their quiet strength and ability to support each other. Even at play, they’re a delight to be with because they’re so friendly, honest, and good-natured.\nBecause of their shared introversion, they’d rather be alone together than out socializing. When they’re enjoying themselves they may hesitate to invite others into the inner circle. They would do well to make friends with a few extraverts who can encourage them to share their fun or work. Spending time solely as a couple can cause the partners to stagnate without their realizing it.\nINFJs are a pleasure to collaborate with when they don’t get too driven. They are clear-thinking, intelligent, and witty. Together, INFJ friends are keen observers of the human scene.\nBy the time they share their insights with each other, they’ve usually covered all the bases. You can’t put much over on a pair of INFJs. Romance\nWhen two INFJs become romantically attached, they may at first feel shy about showing their affection. They aren’t big risk-takers in the business of romance. They make subtle gestures to encourage the object of their affection. They’re cautious about expressing their feelings for fear of rejection.\nIf INFJs seem aloof, it’s because they do such a good job of hiding their feelings. It isn’t easy for them to make their emotional needs known. When two INFJs recognize these qualities in each other, they generally have the patience to fish for clues. Eventually they reveal themselves.\nOnce two INFJs become close, they’re delighted with the treasure they’ve found. Both have rich imaginations and quick minds. They inspire each other to grow and develop without being controlling.\nIf, for some reason, the INFJ/INFJ match isn’t working well, the dissatisfied partner may try to postpone a separation because the intimacy is so important. In cases where one is married and the other isn’t, trouble may result. Since INFJs are loyal and ethical, they’re unlikely to leave a marriage partner. When they do, they suffer guilt and remorse. This isn’t good for any relationship. When two INFJs break up, both suffer. Neither forgets the other. Some longing for the relationship will always remain.\nHome Life\nINFJ partners are idealists as partners and parents. They strive for harmony, sometimes avoiding family conflicts that should be resolved by direct means. When disagreements arise, INFJ partners do well to find privacy and quiet time to discuss them. Because they’re complex people with subtle feelings, conflicts need to be sorted out carefully. Bold confrontations tend to backfire and cause resentments.\nAs parents, INFJs encourage their children to develop a number of skills and get a good education. They will sacrifice considerable time and money to this end.\nIf the children appear rebellious, uncooperative, or difficult for any reason, INFJs try hard to discover the source of the problem. As long as the children put forth genuine effort and appear to be making good use of their intelligence and skills, the parents are mostly happy.\nThe INFJs’ home has an abundance of books, sports equipment, musical instruments, and other paraphernalia scattered around as evidence of the couple’s many interests and hobbies. The more they can share these as a family, the happier they are. At the same time, each needs personal space where he or she can work and think in private.\nThe homes of INFJ couples are sometimes neat and organized, sometimes cluttered. It depends on how caught up they are in current hobbies and interests. Keeping an orderly environment feels good, but it’s not top priority. Their surroundings may be cluttered but their minds are extremely organized.\nSecrets of Success\nINFJs have a strong attraction for each other. To keep their relationship healthy, they need to preserve their needs for personal privacy. They should give each other the space needed for individual pursuits. At the same time, they should take time for social activities that get them out of the house and around other people.\n","date":"April 8, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/69bd5016fbc41a9f5bb6b98fd4e7911a_hue16eeabddb0ce3865ad68d7908be1b0b_42060_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/69bd5016fbc41a9f5bb6b98fd4e7911a_hue16eeabddb0ce3865ad68d7908be1b0b_42060_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/is-romance-in-the-air-infj-meets-infj/","title":"Is Romance in the Air? INFJ Meets INFJ"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\rIf you’re an INFJ, you may find yourself drawn to ISTPs. They’re quietly competent, people of few words who make every utterance worth listening to. They pay attention. They have emotional control. How refreshing!\nINFJs and ISTPs have very different personalities. The only trait they have in common is introversion (I). Because both are private people, they prefer thinking about things to talking about them. They’re quiet, but their minds are always busy.\nWhat about the other traits? First, ISTPs, being sensing (S) types, are matter-of-fact and observant of what’s going on around them. Intuitive INFJs, being more creative and less down-to-earth, are often unaware of details. They lose things like cell phones and credit cards frequently.\nSecond, the ISTP, a thinking type (T), makes decisions based on the facts and logic of a situation, not emotional nuances. If they’re paying to have a job done and the work is shoddy, the INFJ may worry about confronting the worker and hurting his or her feelings. The ISTP is more objective. The job isn’t satisfactory and the worker must be told.\nFinally, perceiving (P) ISTPs avoid final decisions and are more comfortable when things are left open-ended. They’re casual about appointments and deadlines. They can undertake two or three projects at a time.\nINFJs do only one thing at a time, and they’re punctual and deadline-oriented. With their preference for judging (J), they like to see decisions made and situations brought to closure. Friendship\nWhile INFJs and ISTPs may have philosophical differences, they can complement each other in practical ways as friends. Unlike INFJs, ISTPs generally have good eye-hand coordination and understand how things work. Faced with a car repair, for example, the INFJ can usually rely on an ISTP friend to figure out what’s wrong with the vehicle before making a deal with a mechanic. ISTPs are unlikely to be fooled by mechanics or other fixers of things. They may even be able to repair the car themselves. Because they rely on their sensing preference more than their intuition, they think problems through while working on them. Unlike INFJs, they’re not interested in theories.\nWhen a friendship between these two types runs aground, it’s usually because of conflicts in thinking and feeling. ISTPs make decisions based on facts father than feelings and values. This impersonal approach gives them a tendency to be unaware of the reactions of others to the things they do. They may not even be clear about their own emotions.\nAlthough INFJs do examine the facts, they’re more likely to be concerned with the impact of their decisions on others. Because of this difference, the ISTP can offend the INFJs without meaning to. Romance\nWhen ISTPs are looking for romance they seek partners who give them freedom to follow their own interests or, better yet, share these interests. An ISTP who loves camping may persuade an INFJ of the fun of sleeping in a tent. If the INFJ shows some enthusiasm, the ISTP may acquaint the person details about types of tents, sleeping bags, and cooking equipment. Before long, the two are likely to find themselves planning a trip to the nearest state park for a weekend.\nBecause both types are shy about expressing their feelings toward each other in words, they look for other ways to show their affection, such as finding gifts that will please the partner. They offer to cook, run errands, and do other practical favors. They prefer to show their feelings through actions rather than words. They don’t often speak words of love to each other, because they believe that the things they do together convey the message. The way they talk about their relationship is likely to be subtle and indirect. The words “I love you” don’t come easily. It’s easier to say, “Let’s eat at this restaurant again soon.”\nIf one partner decides to leave the other, the rejected ISTP is quiet about his or her suffering.\nISTPs don’t give up easily on their relationships unless the facts make it obvious that the partnership won’t work out. A rejected INFJ may take longer to recover from a broken romance and be reluctant to take the risk to move on. Home Life\nWhen an INFJ and ISTP decide to make their relationship permanent and live together, they usually find that it takes effort and patience to preserve the bond that they enjoyed initially. To avoid unnecessary friction, the two must respect each other’s ways of thinking and feeling. The ISTP should try to understand the INFJs need for emotional support. For this to happen, usually the INFJ must explain his or her needs to the ISTP and make suggestions for meeting them. At the same time, INFJs shouldn’t expect ISTPs to be their sole source of emotional support. They need to cultivate a few friends who can empathize with their feelings. It’s a good idea to spread dependency needs around.\nSecrets of Success\nA well-matched pair of INFJs and ISTJs can complement each other in ways that benefit them both. The INFJ can appreciate the ISTP’s ability to enjoy the details of life without over-thinking, as INFJs tend to do. ISTPs have an uncomplicated way of viewing the world. This can be a relief to the complex INFJ for whom very little is easy. The ISTP’s life is enriched by the creative, witty INFJ who is usually a pleasure to be around.\n","date":"April 8, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/2949e6df0ecf4539e04f5ed191c5bb7a_hu8ebc3618c38780b0d1f6888b600e2180_46099_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/2949e6df0ecf4539e04f5ed191c5bb7a_hu8ebc3618c38780b0d1f6888b600e2180_46099_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/is-romance-in-the-air-infj-meets-istp/","title":"Is Romance in the Air?

The concept helps people understand the extent of their self-awareness compared to how others perceive them. It was developed in the mid-1950s by two psychologists who combined their first names to label the idea: Joseph Luft and Harrington Ingham (Jo-Hari).\nHow much of ourselves do we hide from others? How open are we to letting people see us as we are? In fact, how prepared are we to admitting our own flaws and strengths?\nThe Arena quadrant consists of adjectives, both positive and negative, that the subject uses to describe him or herself, as well as those that peers identify in him or her. The Façade or Hidden quadrant consists of things that subjects are aware of about themselves but that they conceal from others.\nThe Blind Spot quadrant is the reverse—that is, it describes qualities that subjects are unaware of, but that peers perceive about them. Finally, the Unknown quadrant describes qualities unknown to either the subject or others. One therapeutic target for subjects may be the expansion of the Arena quadrant at the expense of both the Unknown and Blind spot quadrants. By increasing self-knowledge and disclosing more of one’s own qualities to others, ordinarily protected by the Facade quadrant, one increases the opportunities for friendship and intimacy.\nA disproportionately large Blind spot can be a source of misunderstanding and friction. Subjects who know little about themselves—less than others do— may be regarded as self-centered, difficult, or inauthentic. When neither the subject nor his or her peers are aware of the subject’s deeper qualities, as in the Unknown quadrant, the result may be dangerous. A person this isolated can harm others without those around them suspecting that the potential existed. Violent individuals can fall into this category—preying on unsuspecting victims.

If they’re happy babies, will they be happy adults? Or do experiences early in life play a major role in what they become?\nPsychologists believe that both are true. According to experts in Myers-Briggs personality testing, people are born with certain traits or tendencies. Their attitudes and behaviors may be modified by the environment over time, but they don’t disappear entirely. The child who likes to play catch and climb trees will probably be an athletic grown-up. The one who reads books in her room for hours is more likely to be a scholar.\nA previous blog described introverted children—quiet, shy types. This one is about extraverted (I) children—kids who are outgoing and enjoy social activities. There are eight types of extraverts according to Myers-Briggs theory. They differ in the combinations of the other three pairs of traits on the personality test: 1) sensing (S) and intuition (N); 2) feeling (F) and thinking (T); and 3) perceiving (P) and judging (J). The scores on four pairs range from one extreme to another, with some close to the middle.\nSensing (S) kids are observant and aware of all the details around them. Intuitive (N) types are more thoughtful and rely on hunches. Feeling (F) children make decisions based on how they’ll affect other people.\nThose of the thinking (T) type depend on logic and are less likely to focus on outcomes. Perceiving (P) children are easy-going and move from one activity to another. Those with a judging (J) preference are more focused and like to finish things.\nRambunctious Kids\nESTP: Extraverted, Sensing, Thinking and Perceiving\nESTP children are rambunctious kids. They think their lives should be action-packed and full of fun. When things get boring, they stir them up. Because of their outgoing personalities, they make friends easily and enjoy group activities.\nMany are good at sports and work hard to improve their athletic skills. Dancing and other physical activities that involve cooperation also appeal to them. They appreciate nature and are curious about the things they find outdoors. They like being in the fresh air. School is less important to them than real-life experience and socializing. Parents who look for high academic achievement in their ESTP offspring may be disappointed by the grades they bring home.\nResponsible Kids ESTJ: Extraverted, Sensing, Thinking and Judging ESTJ children are logical and organized. They’re responsible, obedient kids, respecting the standards set by adults. They get upset when grown-up rules are changed suddenly—unless they’re given a clear reason. For fun, they enjoy doing things that produce results, such as competing in games. Follow-through is their motto. They don’t understand people who go about things in a haphazard way.\nWhen ESTJ kids take up sports or hobbies, they go to great pains to do them well. The child who wants to learn gymnastics, for example, is diligent about getting to all the practices. They like to have their skills tested. Indeed, they like to have all their accomplishments measured. Parents find that coaching and lessons usually pay off for these kids.\nAffectionate Kids ESFP: Extraverted, Sensing, Feeling and Perceiving Children of the ESFP personality type show their generous, caring nature from the time they’re toddlers. They’re warm, active and full of life. They like to be held and show affection by touching people. They want to bring happiness to those around them. Sometimes, though, they’re self-conscious whey they’re on the receiving end.\nESFPs have sharp eyes. Very little escapes their attention. They tune into the moods of people and notice subtleties in their behaviors. They like to include others in their activities. As observers of life, they point out interesting things to family and friends. These bright and sunny children sail though life with little caution. Parents sometimes worry about their willingness to take risks.\nGenerous Kids ESFJ: Extraverted, Sensing, Feeling and Judging Children with ESFJ personalities are responsible and cooperative. They thrive on praise and personal attention. They’ll put forth considerable effort to gain approval from grown-ups and friends. ESFJs try to do the right thing. Always concerned about the well being of others, they go out of their way to help those in distress—even when it involves making personal sacrifices.\nAs children, they like order and structure. They follow the rules and generally accept them without question. They’re upset by out-of-bounds behavior in other children. People who tell lies also disturb them. When the rules seem unreasonable, ESFJ kids may feel let down by the grown-ups who made them.\nCreative Kids ENFP: Extraverted, Intuitive, Feeling and Perceiving The natural curiosity of ENFP children leads them into endless adventures. They are full of questions. Fueled by their creativity, the spend hours exploring new ways to spend their time—making sand castles, rearranging indoor furniture for their adventures, making up plays, and so on.\nThe charm and energy of ENFP kids attracts friends. Because they’re so persuasive, they’re often chosen as leaders by their peers. They like to experiment, even if it involves taking risks. If someone warns them that poison ivy is dangerous, they’re likely to test the person’s advice. Parents of ENFP offspring often worry about what they’ll get into next.\nSociable Kids ENFJ: Extraverted, Intuitive, Feeling and Judging ENFJ children are cooperative and lively. Once they learn to talk, they never seem to stop. These congenial extraverts need lots of social interaction. Conflict and arguments upset them.\nBright, and sunny, ENFJ kids are always on the go. At school, they sign up for many activities, not just for the experience, but also for a chance to socialize. They bring warmth and vision to whatever they take part in. They’re at their best in situations that call for sensitivity and tact. ENFJs are liberal with praise for others and are well liked. Parents find them a joy to be around.\nRisk-Taking Kids ENTP: Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking and Perceiving ENTPs are lively children who question routine ways of doing things. They rarely accept rules without question. If a requirement seems unreasonable, they try to get around it. Then they justify their behavior with logical explanations.\nBecause these children love challenges, they often engage in risky behaviors. Frequently, they try to outwit authority figures such as parents and teachers. Due to their appealing personal style, it’s easy for them to persuade other children to join them in projects and adventures. Organizers at heart, they even assign roles to them. Parents of ENTP kids do well to have logic on their side when challenged by their offspring.\nGoal-Driven Kids ENTJ: Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking and Judging ENTJ children are driven by goals from the time they’re very young. They can be scholarly, athletic, and creative—all at the same time. They’re like to get straight As in school—as much to satisfy themselves as to please their parents. It’s important for them to win games and come in first in competitions. They like to win.\nKids of the ENTJ type tend to take charge of themselves and others in group activities. They’re born leaders. Power and control are important to them because they want to have an impact on what goes on. When authority figures become too dogmatic, ENTJs rebel. If a situation is acceptable to them, they’ll go along. For parents who’d prefer easy-going, compliant offspring, these children can be a challenge.\nPart 1 of this two-part series described introverted children.\n","date":"April 8, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/16171a8ce68f605dd9adf50716efea95_hu1215ce0f167def2297f40dad55440996_63023_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/16171a8ce68f605dd9adf50716efea95_hu1215ce0f167def2297f40dad55440996_63023_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/myers-briggs-personality-types-of-children-extraverted-kids/","title":"Myers-Briggs Personality Types of Children—Extraverted Kids"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\rIf your baby comes home from the hospital quiet and easy-going, will the peace last? What about the toddler who enjoys nothing more than turning the pages of a book, while another is scaling every surface in sight? Will their personalities change over the years?\nParents who dreamed of their child becoming a celebrated athlete may be disappointed when he or she prefers staying inside taking a clock apart to playing outdoors with friends. Parents hoping for a Rhodes scholar may be let down when their child would rather climb trees than read books. Many experts believe that Myers-Briggs personality tests are unreliable in children. Others claim that infants have their basic personalities in place from the time they take their first breath. Personality scores may shift over the years, but they rarely make an about face.\nThis is about introverted (I) children. There are eight types of introverts according to Myers-Briggs theory. They differ in the combinations of the other three pairs of traits on the personality test: 1) sensing (S) and intuition (N); 2) feeling (F) and thinking (T); and 3) perceiving (P) and judging (J).

Perceiving (P) children are easy-going and move from one activity to another. Those with a judging (J) preference are more focused and like to finish things.\nISFJ: Introverted, Sensing, Feeling and Judging\nAs children, ISFJs are generally well behaved. They’re little trouble to their parents and teachers. They want to know what’s expected of then, and they quietly follow through. Even when asked to make sacrifices, ISFJ kids take pride doing the right thing. In school, they stick with a few close friends and avoid conflict.\nBecause ISFJ children try to be certain about their duties, they tend to do only what they’re told. With their inward focus, they have a tendency to worry about things. For this reason, they may perform below their potential. They need encouragement to stretch themselves.\nISFP: Introverted, Sensing, Feeling and Perceiving\nISFP kids are quiet and kind. Because they avoid the spotlight, their many gifts may be overlooked. They are compassionate not only with other people, but also with animals—and indeed with all living things. They’re easy to like and attract other kids as friends. When arguments arise, they act as peacemakers.\nISFP children appreciate beauty, often making unique gifts for others that are colorful and beautiful. They enjoy the feeling of their bodies in motion—skating, dancing, and simply moving gracefully.\nINFJ: Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling and Judging\nINFJs are complex, even as young children. While they can be outgoing at times and involved with other kids, they’re also quiet and creative, caught up in their private worlds. They’re gentle and dislike violence and cruelty, whether in games or in real life.\nIt’s not uncommon for INFJ children to make frequent trips to the library, bringing home many books at a time and spending hours in their rooms reading. The next day, they’re outdoors having adventures with friends. INFJ kids can be a challenge to parents who find their inconsistency hard to understand.\nINFP: Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling and Perceiving\nINFP children are daydreamers, creating their own fantasy worlds. They are quiet, especially in new situations. Sometimes their parents worry whether they’re sufficiently grounded in reality. These kids enjoy getting lost in books. They learn to write at an early age.\nBefore INFPs even start school, they know what’s important to them. They sense where they’re headed and seldom ask for guidance. They’d rather do things for themselves than get help—to be sure they’re done right. They’re often careful not to reveal their mistakes to others. INFP children benefit from gentle handling and understanding.\nINTJ: Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking and Judging\nThe independent natures of INTJ children are apparent early in life. They like to daydream and get caught up in ideas of how the world should be. They can be rebellious when told things that contradict what they believe. INTJs make their own rules and boundaries.\nThe life of the mind is important to INTJs, so they value their education. They‘re creative and innovative, finding their own efficient ways of doing and making things. These children can be a challenge to parents who would prefer easy-going, compliant children.\nINTP: Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking and Perceiving\nAs children, INTPs often enjoy their own thoughts more than the company of other kids. They generally read a lot, going out to play only when invited. INTPs are full of questions, many times challenging parents and teachers with their observations. More than most children, INTPs enjoy inventing things and finding unusual pastimes not typical of kids their age.\nINTP tastes are not dictated by popular trends. When these children disagree with conventional ideas, they’re quick to find fault in people’s logic, no matter how important the person. Some parents are baffled by the complexity of children who seem to have such a rich inner life.\nISTP: Introverted, Sensing, Thinking and Perceiving\nISTP children have two sides—one that observes the world and one that takes action. The observer likes to sit quietly and watch what’s going on, absorbing all the details. These kids want to know what make things tick, taking them apart to see how they work. Children of this type who play outdoors a lot are frequently experts on bugs, snakes, and other wildlife.\nUsually, ISTPs are good with their hands and can fix things. They aren’t afraid to take risks with such sports as rock-climbing and backpacking. Parents who enjoy quiet children will find much to treasure in the ISTP.\nISTJ: Introverted, Sensing, Thinking and Judging\nAs children, ISTJs are well behaved and quiet. They function best in an environment that’s ordered and structured. With their well-developed sense of responsibility, ISTJs do best when given schedules to follow. They want to get their work done before they play. Around new people, they’re cautious and often uneasy until they get to know them. When ISTJs know what to expect, they’re more relaxed.\nPeople of this personality type take a conventional view of life. While they enjoy solitary pastimes at home, they also appreciate traditional group activities such as scouting. Parents of these conscientious children can help them develop a more playful side of their personalities.\nPart 2 of this series describes the eight types of extraverted children.\n","date":"April 8, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/d430e33769ccbb47771f632252602e27_huc8dc6b7b111c5212fe7e12dce85d44f5_64179_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/d430e33769ccbb47771f632252602e27_huc8dc6b7b111c5212fe7e12dce85d44f5_64179_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/myers-briggs-personality-types-of-children-part-1-introverted-kids/","title":"Myers-Briggs Personality Types of Children—Part 1: Introverted Kids"},{"categories":["ketamine-infusion"],"contents":"\rExploring Shy and Introvert Disney Characters: A Journey Through the Quiet and Reserved\nFlorida Mind Health Center for Ketamine Therapy is Gainesville’s new—and only—ketamine infusion therapy center. Located just off Millhopper Road near NW Thirty-Ninth Street, the clinic offers revolutionary, fast-acting methods bringing comprehensive treatments for a number of resistant mood disorders and pain-related conditions—most notably, depression and anxiety. Many patients experience improvement after just one session, making ketamine infusions an option superior to traditional treatment methods.\nKetamine works by blocking a certain type of neural receptor from being triggered in the brain. Think of your brain’s neural pathways as a series of streets. Certain disorders and recurring pain make it difficult for the brain to repair roadblocks or potholes. The damage that may develop due to the side effects of traditional medications is repaired by ketamine.\nAt the low doses employed by the Florida Mind Health Clinic, ketamine has been proven to restore healthy neural pathways in the brain without those side effects. The ketamine is delivered by infusion droplets in a bag of diluted saline. Once the needle is inserted into a vein, the process is painless. The only effect noticed by the patient is a series of images noticed behind closed eyes.\nAn hour-long infusion is done under the constant attendance of a board-certified nurse anesthetist. The treatment is carried out in a private clinic room with the patient comfortably prone in a reclining chair. When the last drop of ketamine has been administered—the patient gradually returns to his or her normal state of consciousness.\nZohar Levites, CRNA, ARNP, MS, is the owner and chief administrator of the Florida Mind Health Clinic. He has been a board-certified nurse anesthetist since 2008. His previous medical experience, spanning over 20 years, also includes critical care, obstetrics, pain management and psychiatric care. The wealth of his experience comes from clinical appointments in Russian, Israeli, and US practices as well as intermittent mission work in developing countries. He is actively involved in academic research.\nLevites has presented lectures related to anesthesia-related medical decision-making and anxiety management at international and national conferences. In 2014, he was voted Teacher of the Year by emergency medicine residents at the University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville. He also received an Excellence in Teaching award for his unique, trainee-centered approach to airway rotation training.\n","date":"April 8, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/e9998088a10e5039febe1fe4091e0fca_hu4b824d245904696962a9f8970578b8b3_32700_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/e9998088a10e5039febe1fe4091e0fca_hu4b824d245904696962a9f8970578b8b3_32700_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/new-gainesville-ketamine-infusion-clinic/","title":"New Gainesville Ketamine Infusion Clinic"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\rWe INFJs, like the other fifteen Myers-Briggs types, have our weak spots—vulnerabilities that sometimes bring us into conflict with others or cause personal problems. To be healthy and fully functional, we need to take advantage of all eight Myers-Briggs traits: introvert (I), extravert (E), sensing (S), intuitive (N), thinking (T), feeling (F), judging (J), and perceiving (P).\nI am a good example:\nAs an INFJ\nI tend to prefer solitude or the company of only one or two friends (I). Crowded social scenes turn me off. My intuitive nature (N) blesses me with creativity, fresh insights into the future, and the ability to second-guess others—sometimes a source of annoyance to them. - As a feeling (F) type, I am mindful of the effects of my actions on others and concerned about their well-being, although I can take my emotional tendencies too far. - The judging tendencies of my personality (J) make me prompt, reliable and conscientious, but sometimes overdemanding. My News Year’s Resolutions\nThis year, I won’t be such a mole. When invited to a social event, I won’t go straight to my default “NO.” At least I’ll say, “Let me think about it,” or “Let me check my calendar.” I’ll answer the phone every time it rings unless caller ID tells me it’s a telemarketer. When the doorbell rings, I won’t pretend that no one is home. When I do my taxes this year, I won’t make numbers up. I’ll actually look for my records. Sometimes, when someone asks, “How are you doing?” I’ll give them an honest answer. If I want or need help, I’ll ask for it. Instead of fretting over personal conflicts, I’ll go straight to the source. When a problem arises, I’ll press for a straightforward talk about it. I’ll offer sincere praise and thanks to others when it’s due. I’ll allow others to explain their opinions and objections without countering every argument. I will not confuse my intellectual excitement with hands-on achievement. I will listen to others, even when I don’t agree with them. In an argument, I will look for common ground before focusing on differences. I will find something to praise in the arguments of another person. I will not be condescending or sarcastic. I will smile genuinely at least once during an exchange of points. I will remember that listening doesn’t mean agreeing. When disagreeing with someone, I will avoid rude comments and insults. Rather than end an argument angrily, I will thank the other person for his or her time and opinion. Before leaving an argument I will extend the hand of friendship. “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.”\n","date":"April 8, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/825db1280885cb4f10e88bc7c0f6907a_hue4a2dbdd11f72d09f57cae23a7d00be5_46333_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/825db1280885cb4f10e88bc7c0f6907a_hue4a2dbdd11f72d09f57cae23a7d00be5_46333_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/am/","title":"New Year’s Resolutions for INFJs"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\rAccording to researchers, the INFJ Myers-Briggs type occurs in about 1% of the population—the lowest prevalence of any type. Studies vary regarding the exact percentages of the 16 types, but INFJs always walk away with the prize for the most rare.\nThe downside of being an INFJ is that there are few people out there with whom they can relate deeply. Also, they don’t fit into social norms because their qualities are unusual and, to some people, unsettling.\nINFJs can size up others quickly and those who don’t like to be sized up are likely to avoid them. Friends and colleagues find many INFJs almost clairvoyant. The upside for INFJs is that they have gifts not common in other types. This makes them valued as leaders, workers, and friends. They also have rich interior lives.\nIn work settings, INFJs collaborate well with the second rarest type, ENTJs—also known as the CEO type. While ENTJs prefer the footlights, INFJs are happy to operate behind the scenes. Both types are intuitive; when they combine their insights they make a formidable team. INFJs can soften the edges of ENTJs, who prefer logic and rationality and are often insensitive to the feelings of others. The quiet, tactful INFJ can steer the ENTJ away from decisions that will alienate colleagues. Since the two share a Judging preference, the two types can forge productive partnerships and get a lot done.\nAt the other end of the scale are the three most prevalent types, shown in dark green: the ISTJ, ESFJ, and ISFJ. Each constitutes between 11% and 14% of the general population, for a total of over 35%. The ISTJ, sometimes called the Inspector, is reliable, works conscientiously, and follows rules and regulations. INFJs and ISTJs often have trouble understanding each other, probably because they have neither intuition nor feeling in common. ESFJs, called Harmonizers, are friendly facilitators. ISFJs, called Protectors, live to serve others often at the expense of their own interests. The ESFJs and ISFJs are liked and admired by most people.

The readers have themselves been victims of rape. I’d never considered this idea before, but I think they’re onto something.\nIn my opinion, INFJs tend to have stronger emotional reactions to events than other types. Sexual assault is a particularly damaging experience and PTSD is common among rape victims. Many suffer for months, years or even a lifetime.\nRole of Myers Briggs Preferences\nThe combination of I, N, F and J functions in INFJs sets the stage for PTSD.\nIntroversion causes them to isolate after an assault—the last thing a rape victim needs to do. Rape victims must have support and protection but they’re afraid to seek it. Intuition prompts INFJs to seek meaning in personal situations. In most cases of rape, this is a fruitless exercise because rapists are hostile to women in general, not one woman in particular. Most rapists have assaulted women before and they’ll do it again unless stopped by the legal system. The feeling function of INFJs often prevents them from taking an objective view of events—an admittedly difficult undertaking in cases of rape. It’s a highly personal crime. The judging function disposes INFJs to seek closure on issues. After rape, a woman wants to be vindicated and have the attacker brought to justice. This seldom comes about, and as a result there is no closure. My Experience\nOn a business trip to St. Augustine, Florida, I stayed at a Holiday Inn. After working all day, I wanted to relax before retiring to my room so I went to the lounge for a gin and tonic. (I was still drinking alcohol at the time.) A hotel security guard in his fifties sat next to me at the bar. He struck up a conversation. I stayed for a second drink and then a third. Before finishing my last drink, I said, “I need to turn in. I have a busy day tomorrow.”\nThe guard said, “Let me escort you to your room.” I thought that at my age I hardly needed an escort—but he was, after all, a security guard. Being more polite than I am now, I consented. Gallantly he offered to carry my drink, walking behind me in the hall.\nAfter dropping my keycard into the slot and pushing the door open, I turned to take my drink from the guard. Without warning he kissed me. Surprised and confused, I laughed nervously and said goodnight. I went into my room, shutting the door behind me, took my clothes off and got into bed.\nAfter sleeping a short time, I heard the doorknob turning. The guard had used his passkey to enter. He walked to the bed without a word, climbed on top of me, raped me, and left. I lay there groggy and confused. The attack seemed unreal. Strangely, I fell asleep again—a fact that amazes me to this day. I think the guard may have slipped a date-rape drug in my drink while walking behind me in the hallway.\nWaking at dawn I felt foggy but knew that something was terribly wrong. I ran my hands over my body and felt grease on my thighs. It looked like suntan lotion. Slowly the hazy events of the night before came back.\nFeeling surreal, I threw on some clothes and walked on the beach for an hour, trying to figure out what to do. I decided to report the attack to the Holiday Inn manager. This was a mistake. It gave the manager time to cover the hotel’s tracks and alert corporate lawyers. Then I went to the police. That wasn’t much better.\nBack home in Gainesville, I spent the next few weeks isolating myself, fearful and depressed. I was ill, throwing up frequently and suffering migraines. I seldom left the house, never answered the door, and rarely picked up the phone. The least noise made me jump. Finally I called a friend and told her what happened. She put me in touch with the Gainesville Rape Victim Crisis Center. They told me I had acute PTSD.\nFor six weeks, I attended a support group at the Crisis Center. The four other women in the group had stories as bad or worse than mine. One woman had been raped by an orderly while on a hospital gurney in an elevator. He stopped between floors to assault her, then begged her not to tell anyone because he had a wife and family. He almost persuaded her.\nReader Responses\nOne reader responded: “I also suffer from acute PTSD. I was curious if you were aware of your personality type before your traumatic events. I am trying to see if the PTSD changed my personality or if I have just become more self-aware and mature. I never thought about my INFJ traits compounding my PTSD.” Referring to her chronic stress syndrome, she added, “In my condition, just saying ‘hello’ or working up the courage to go outside alone again have been almost insurmountable obstacles.”\nAnother INFJ woman wrote, “Is there anyone out there with suggestions about how an INFJ can possibly deal with a violent assault on top of the issues assigned to us as INFJs?”\nMy own experience with rape makes me think that I might have recovered from my PTSD faster had I been a different Myers-Briggs type. The combination of introversion, the introspection that goes with intuitiveness, and the tendency to react to situations emotionally probably made matters more difficult. Support groups helped me deal with the trauma. I needed to recognize that I did not invite the attack. I was simply walking through someone’s gunsights.\nI’m still susceptible to triggers that catch me unawares. A couple of years ago, a male acquaintance came to my house uninvited. I met him in the front yard. At least, I had the sense not to invite him in. As we were standing on the lawn, he put his arms around me. I went into my old mode of getting confused and laughing nervously. I asked him to leave because I had things to do in the house.\nPTSD Symptoms\nFor the rest of the day, I tried to avoid dwelling on the situation. I went to dinner with a friend that night. Returning home around 9 pm, I felt a migraine starting. Then I got nauseated and threw up several times. I thought I might have food poisoning. I finally realized that my old PTSD was back, triggered by the man’s advances.\nAlthough my symptoms were gone the next day, I was dismayed that I’d learned so little from the rape a few years earlier. I decided to see a therapist. After several sessions, I’d gained more insight into my PTSD. I could see that my defenses still needed work.\nRecovery\nMy therapist taught me to turn my rational brain off and my primitive brain on when a man violates my boundaries. It’s important to defend myself without analyzing the situation. (I tend to overthink troubling issues.)\nFortunately, I’ve had chances to practice. Predatory men aren’t hard to find. Now, when a man puts his hands on me and makes me uncomfortable, I no longer laugh nervously or get confused. I take a deep breath and say, “Please don’t touch me.” Of course, this usually triggers a dismayed protest of innocence. Predators can be good actors. All I need to say in response is, “You heard me.” He rarely comes back for seconds.\nGetting Support\nWomen who have been raped need support—particularly the support of other women who have undergone sexual assault. They need to realize that they are not to blame. Most of all, they need to claim their personal power and become more assertive.\nAs females past our teen years, we are not children. We are women with a right to be strong and free.\n(Note: I haven’t written about teenage girls because it’s outside the range of my personal experience, both as a female victim and as a mental health counselor. I am convinced, however, that rape is unusually devastating for these young women. They fear exposure, shame, and the risk that people won’t believe them.)\n","date":"April 8, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/3178571165a1609cedd2e60c472de21f_hufe520d38b05f44450c3f014384050a65_104638_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/3178571165a1609cedd2e60c472de21f_hufe520d38b05f44450c3f014384050a65_104638_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/pstd-in-infj-women-after-sexual-assault/","title":"PSTD in INFJ Women After Sexual Assault"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\rReturn of Bambi and Thumper\nTanja Askani, a Czech author, photographer, and animal scientist living in Germany, has disseminated a series of Bambi-Thumper photos that have gone viral on the internet. People find them adorable. When I received the series in my e-mail, I thought they looked too good to be true. They were.\nAfter downloading the photos and examining them in zoom view, I found clear evidence that every photo had been altered substantially.\nWe’re not talking about subtle adjustments in contrast or lighting. The “reality” of animal tenderness and bonding shown in the photos is the result of digital artifice. Photoshop Magic\nAskani’s creative combinations of two more photos into one made me wonder. Were the deer and rabbit ever actually nose to nose? My hunch is that Askani got some good shots but could not resist tinkering with them. I think she ended up creating the photos she wished she had taken, not the ones she actually took. Being a Photoshop expert, I know the temptation to make a good image better. But pasting one image on top of another and passing it off as a miracle of interspecies bonding is fraud.\nArrows in the photos point to some of the areas of Photoshop fakery. The paste-ins, blending and use of line tools and brushes weren’t even done skillfully. Methinks Ms. Askani has got herself in a bind with her now-famous Bambi-Thumper photographs. How can she acknowledge her deception (which will surely be exposed) and maintain any kind of reputation as an animal photographer? Or animal scientist, for that matter.\n","date":"April 8, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/2239ef086ff483cfdac0b334c0196ecc_hu0e0fbe826ec008effd81d1fda9b01bb3_49283_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/2239ef086ff483cfdac0b334c0196ecc_hu0e0fbe826ec008effd81d1fda9b01bb3_49283_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/tanja-askani-creator-of-the-new-bambi-and-thumper/","title":"Tanja Askani–Creator of the New Bambi and Thumper"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\rAre you prone to playing the “blame game” when something goes wrong in your life? Do you have friends or relatives who do it? There are lots of synonyms for “blame”—for example, “hold responsible or accountable”, “condemn,” “accuse,” “find guilty,” “assign fault,” or even “point the finger.”\nIf you automatically blame your partner when you fall on the kitchen linoleum, you might accuse him or her of not keeping the kitchen floor clean—ignoring the fact that you were clumsy because you were hurried and careless. If dogs raid the cat food you leave on the deck outdoors, you might blame your kids for not bringing in the food bowls at night. If a tree limb falls on your parked car, you might berate the property owners for not keeping their trees pruned—never thinking of other possible causes such as strong winds.\nOn the other hand, you may play the blame game with yourself, faulting yourself even when you had nothing to do with a harmful outcome. Some people find themselves at fault for every bad thing that happens. If your partner slips on the kitchen floor, you might blame yourself for not mopping it the night before. When dogs sneak off with the cat food on the deck, you might blame yourself for not reminding the kids of their nightly chores. When a tree limb dents the hood of your car, you might blame yourself for lacking the ability to foresee the event. In short, you use your own personal failures as a vehicle for seeing yourself as foolish, clumsy or irresponsible.\nPeople with this inclination also have a tendency to feel that good fortune or chance is responsible for any successes in their lives, not themselves. In either case, the focus is on past events and the unfavorable outcome is not dealt with constructively—that is, as a learning experience. “I’m sorry you slipped on the floor. Don’t you think it’s time we hired a housekeeper to help us keep up with the household chores?” “Kids, I’ll take the catfood in the house at night from now on, but I’m going to dock your allowance by a dollar a week.”\nSome religious people blame God for their misfortunes. Perhaps they entertain thoughts of a malignant Higher Power, punishing them for past “sins” that justify retribution. Or they may simply believe that their Higher Power is doing them a favor by pointing out their weaknesses.\nPsychologists have various theories on the subject of blame that have to do with the intention of people’s acts. If an immoral act hurts no one, the subject of blame is usually sidestepped. If the act was intended to harm and did so, the story is quite different. For example, if kids throw rocks at cars from an overpass and the rocks hit no cars, the subject is dismissed from most people’s minds. If one rock hits a car’s windshield, causing a freeway fatality, the search is on for the guilty party. Moral luck is the belief that someone is to blame only when the action harms others, not when no one is hurt.\nTherefore, we blame the kids who caused the fatality and attribute less blame to those whose rocks missed their mark—when actually all the rock throwers are equally at fault. Blaming is a way of devaluing others, with the result that the accusers feel superior, seeing others as less worthwhile and making themselves feel perfect. The problem with blame is that accusations target the outcomes of past events rather than the lessons they offer. If a dog escapes from the back yard repeatedly, causing complaints from neighbors of even visits from Animal Control, the blamer might accuse family members of leaving doors open, not checking for fence holes, and so on. Proactive dog owners are more likely to check the yard themselves for escape routes. If they find any, they can pay a handyman to repair gaps, fill holes in the soil under fencing, or even surround the perimeter with underground fencing.If the problem is doors left ajar, automatic door closers can be installed. This avoids family arguments about who is to blame and who should fix the problem.\nThe blame game only establishes historical guilt and encourages the accuser to feel above it all. It does nothing to resolve future occurrences of the same problem. Played out in personal life, it generally makes the “guilty” party feel angry and picked on, while the blamer feels smug and superior. The constructive alternative to blame is to ask how the problem can be avoided in the future.\n","date":"April 8, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/b375ae6c7bb4cbe0bcbdef0ef80d705c_hu039a481c2ecf6b7ddafbf7d58e3dcc5a_35910_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/b375ae6c7bb4cbe0bcbdef0ef80d705c_hu039a481c2ecf6b7ddafbf7d58e3dcc5a_35910_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/the-blame-game/","title":"The Blame Game"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\rIn my AA home group, we start meetings by reading from the Big Book: “AA is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization, or institution.” Then we end with the Lord’s Prayer.\nThere’s something wrong here. The Lord’s Prayer is from the New Testament of the Christian Bible (Matthew 6:9-13). As a Christian Internet source states. “Through this prayer, Jesus invited us to approach God as Father. Indeed, the Lord’s Prayer has been called a summary of the Christian gospel.”\nLike many other members of AA, I am not a Christian. My spirituality does not embrace a God of either gender.\nThe Big Book chapter “We Agnostics” states: “When therefore, we speak to you of God, we mean your own conception of God” and “To us the Realm of Sprit is broad, roomy, all inclusive.” The Lord’s Prayer is a long-running hot topic that crops up regularly at AA meetings around the world. To many alcoholics, the Lord’s Prayer is a mandatory part of the AA meeting ritual. They don’t stop to consider that insulting people like me with a prayer we don’t believe in—making us feel apart from instead of part of—goes against the grain of the fellowship’s philosophy.\nA study of AA groups around the world asked AA members what prayers they use at their meetings. Responses came from sober Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Shintoists, Native Americans, atheists, and pagans from North America, Europe, Australia, Asia and Africa.

Please understand, I don’t have a grudge against Rolex watches because I can’t afford one–although, at an average price of $8000, it would pinch a little. I like the way the Timex looks–modest, practical, tasteful. It doesn’t shout, “Look at me! I’M RICH!” Also, a Timex watch is not a fussy gadget. It’s a workhorse.\nLighted dial\nTimex watches have lighted dials. Rolex watches do not. Eight grand and no lighted dial? Come on. True, some have “luminescent” dials, but Rolex wearers say that the glow lasts a couple of hours at best. The Rolex owner who wakes in the dark wanting to know the time has to grope for a bedside lamp. Timex wearers just push the Indiglo button. Voila. The dial lights up clear as day.\nKeeps on ticking…\nTimex watches run for years on a single battery. Rolex watches, the manufacturer boasts, are self-winding. But only if you wear them regularly. If leave your watch on the dresser for more than 48 hours, it’s likely to go dead.\nWhat’s more, the manufacturer warns, “The lubricants in the mechanism may harden, causing friction within the movement. Eventually, the friction may damage the movement.” For an $8000 miracle of technology, this watch sounds pretty touchy.\nMugger appeal\nNo one’s going to mug you for a lousy Timex. On the other hand, the Rolex is a mugger magnet. Using the good sense that made them rich, Rolex owners often leave their watches in a sock drawer when they go to Detroit on business or take the family on vacation to Mexico City. While they’re gone, the Rolex sits in the dark drawer grumbling about neglect, stiffening of lubricants, etc., and plotting revenge. Who needs that?\nWater resistance\nThe Timex is water resistant to a depth of 99 feet. Rolex watches are good to 330 feet. Yay for Rolex. Personally, I can’t think of an occasion in this life when I or anybody I know would be submerging a watch under more than a couple of feet of water.\nThe manufacturer says, “This waterproofing means that not only can you take a shower while wearing your watch, but you can also swim with it. Deep water diving, however, should be avoided while wearing most Rolex watches. For such demanding aquatic situations, Rolex has created the Submariner and the Sea-Dweller models.”\nSay again? Didn’t I just read that the Rolex is waterproof to 330 feet? What exactly qualifies as “deep water diving”?\nThe manufacturer goes on: “If you own or choose to purchase a non-diver Rolex watch, treat it as no more than moderately water resistant due to the age and custom craftsmanship involved in its production. To be safe, we suggest the watch not be worn while swimming or even showering, although a slight amount of water contact–such as may occur while washing your hands.” (Italics mine.)\nExcuse me while I roll on the floor laughing.\nCleaning the watch\nMy Timex must take life as it comes. Not a Rolex. The manufacturer writes, “Like any other work of intricate artistry and technology, a Rolex requires occasional cleaning and upkeep. There are many places on the watch where dirt, body oils, and other greasy particles accumulate–such as between the links on the bracelet, the area joining the case and the bezel, and around the Cyclops lens. With repeated use and the gathering of dirt particles, your watch will require a thorough cleaning as described here.” Hoo boy. I’ll spare you the detailed instructions. Let me just say that I once had an MG TD that required less maintenance. And it was a hell of a lot more fun.\nWristband\nIn case you have nothing better to do with your evenings, the Rolex people suggest polishing and cleaning the wristband of the watch. “The bracelet of your Rolex needs special care, as it is prone to scratches. This is especially true of the Oyster bracelet which features polished center links.”\nIn other words, the surface of this fussy gadget goes to hell easily.\nAre you ready for this? “Make sure you use the cloth only on the polished surface of your bracelet. If you use it on the non-polished surface, it will damage the brushed finish. One way to avoid polishing the brushed surfaces is to use a Q-Tip, wrapping the polishing cloth around its head and carefully restricting the buffing movement to the targeted areas. Avoid using circular or cross strokes while polishing. Instead, try to follow the flow of the metal. In other words, go with the grain of the surface (not against the grain). “\nPass me the Q-Tip, please. I need to clean my ears. What did they say this wristband was made of? Pewter?\nThere’s more. “Finally, avoid polishing surfaces that have no scratches. You will end up removing a fine layer of metal from the surface by way of polishing because the surface has not suffered any indentation in the form of a scratch. In these areas, less is more.” Except that you’ll need a jeweler’s loupe and a microscope.\nViolins, please\u0026hellip;\nThe manufacturer ends on this inspiring note: “By treating your Rolex with the respect and care that such a great treasure deserves, you will continue to enjoy a machine that looks and functions as a brand new watch for decades to come.”\nOr, you could just buy a twenty-five dollar Timex, never wind or clean it, and get a new battery every two or three years. If the watch falls down a manhole or is stolen from a washroom, no tragedy. Buy another.\nThe next time someone brags about his Rolex, ask to see the lighted dial.\n","date":"April 8, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/94a398323882e863a7e1a5598cd12b2a_hu35e78f07bf43456c77f9d07f7f51607a_50071_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/94a398323882e863a7e1a5598cd12b2a_hu35e78f07bf43456c77f9d07f7f51607a_50071_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/timex-or-rolex/","title":"Timex or Rolex?"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\rOnly this year, after my 78th birthday, did I discover Tom Waits.

They’re almost clairvoyant. In addition, they’re compassionate and generous. They are protectors of the weak. As idealists, they have strong values. And they get a lot done. While they prefer private time to socializing, they use their solitude productively.\nINFJs can be depended on to come through—and to come through on time. How can they miss? Any Myers-Briggs type can overuse or abuse one or more traits. Ways of Losing Out When INFJs act on their ideals and do good in the world, all is well. But some INFJs focus on their visions without doing anything except talk about them. If unpleasant realities come along that contradict their utopian views, they try to ignore their existence. Focusing on their single-minded beliefs, they cling to goals that can’t be attained. INFJs who have painted themselves into this corner need to reframe their visions, attune them to reality, and be more flexible in their objectives.\nMany INFJs dislike conflicts and go to great lengths to avoid them. As a result, they may fail to be assertive about important issues—only to find later that their ideas are overlooked or played down. People who might have been their allies don’t come through because the INFJ didn’t share his or her thinking.\nSimilarly, INFJs may be so conflict-avoidant that they’re afraid to voice criticisms that might offend friends or colleagues. Even though their concerns are valid, they keep them bottled up for fear of creating ill will. Their negative energy builds up, like steam in a kettle. When the pressure gets too great, they blow up, causing conflict and making the resolution of problems difficult. In reality, their fears of antagonizing others are mostly groundless. INFJs are masters of tact. They can count on their customary encouraging style of communication to reassure others that their intentions are good.\nAnother way INFJs lose out is by focusing obsessively on minor details. An INFJ preparing to give a seminar, for example, may get so caught up in preparation of name-tags, seating arrangements, projection equipment, and so on, that he or she doesn’t spend enough time on the presentation itself. The students are there to listen to the INFJ. The housekeeping details aren’t that important.\nGetting Support INFJs are, of course, introverts.\nAsking for advice isn’t their long suit. But getting help from others is a major ingredient of success. Also, the very process of discussion prompts INFJs to come up with ideas and insights of their own.

When the conditions aren’t “ideal” for me, I get distracted easily. Disarray puts me in a jumpy mood and I don’t stay on task very long. A review of the literature suggests that I’m not alone.\nAccording to behavioral scientists, several conditions influence your motivation to study:\nRegular Routine\nThe demands of everyday life can be distracting, making it easy to get sidetracked into extraneous tasks. This is why it’s crucial to create a daily routine, with time clearly allocated to study.\nClaiming set times in a routine is particularly helpful if you live with someone who needs to learn when to leave you to yourself. Your special time allocated to studying should be clear to everyone.\nAmbient Noise\nIf you live someplace surrounded with noisy friends or family, you won’t be able to hear yourself think. You may find yourself getting irritated and distracted.\nIf this happens, it’s wise to scout around for an alternative study space where you’ll get peace and quiet as you concentrate on your notes and books. If worse comes to worst, get some earphones that block out environmental sounds. And disable your phone for a while. Although some people can stay focused when surrounded by chaos, noise generally disrupts mental processes. Many students vow that soft music or a television set turned on low keeps them on task and in no way hampers their concentration. Researchers would challenge that claim. They have found that environmental noise—background music, city sounds, people’s conversations—leads to a decrease in performance for most people. While these things can improve positive emotions, increase performance in sports, and make people complete tasks a little faster, they have disruptive consequences for reading and studying—a chilling finding for students addicted to ambient noise.\nPersonal Space\nWhether you are in your room in a dormitory or in a public place like a library or a coffee shop you need to create your own space. Set some boundaries between you and the outside world with familiar personal objects. If you’re in a coffee shop, find a table by yourself, discourage visitors by filling the table with coffee cups, napkins, notes, etc. This not only discourages intruders, but it creates peace of mind. “This space is mine alone.” Embellishments make the workplace inviting to you and discourage outsiders who might otherwise interrupt your work.\nBy returning to or recreating the same work environment over and over, you help safeguard yourself against blocks to studying.\nTidy Work Area\nMany students pore over their books in a messy environment. It’s not what they prefer, but it’s what they do, mostly out of task avoidance or downright laziness. If you belong to this category of students, you’d best tidy up your study area before attempting to work. It’s surprising what a salutary effect this has on productivity. You don’t have to break your concentration looking for items you’ve misplaced. A tidy desktop clears the mind.\nComfort\nYour desk chair should be large enough to take your full weight and support your back. Backaches are not conducive to good study habits. You should have a desk that will give you plenty of clean space to work on.\nYour computer screen should be adjusted to the correct angle and distance for easy viewing. The room should be tidy and air-conditioned, or heated to a temperature that feels comfortable to you. Students’ Accessories\nIf you use the internet for research, you need a reliable and fast internet connection for easy access to information. Your laptop or desktop computer should have a keyboard that’s comfortable for typing. If you take notes while working, have a writing pad and pens or pencils handy. In other words, create an efficient and well-stocked study center,\nAttire\nWearing pajamas may work for some people, but it makes many of us sleepy and tired, wanting only to retreat to our beds for a short restorative nap. Dressing to the nines has the opposite detrimental effect. We’ve prepared ourselves to go out on the town, not work at our keyboard. Wear garments that make you feel presentable, clean and alert, but not all dressed up with no place to go.\nShoes? By all means, go without. Based on observations of thousands of children from 25 countries over 10 years, academics concluded that children who slip off their shoes are more likely to arrive at school earlier, leave later and read more widely. Comprehensive new research suggests that “shoeless” kids are more engaged in lessons, leading to better concentration and test results.\nSTOP!\nThere are times when attempting to study is just not a good idea. One thing is clear – if you are angry or upset, the last thing you should do is to try some serious studying. It requires a clear mind, unclouded by negative thoughts. Wait until your feathers are no longer ruffled. Then go for it.\n","date":"April 8, 2023","image":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/cf9b2560c9ba1fd42d80d2e8f47c6849_hu29d3860f7d1a2988f072d69d411311f1_36679_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"mb-4\" width=\"650\" height=\"\" onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog\\/cf9b2560c9ba1fd42d80d2e8f47c6849_hu29d3860f7d1a2988f072d69d411311f1_36679_650x0_resize_box_3.png'\"\u003e\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","permalink":"/wp/your-study-habits/","title":"Your Study Habits"},{"categories":["INFJ","Myers-Briggs Type Indicator","wildlife","wild-dogs","pets","animal-welfare"],"contents":" Do you ever get a gut feeling about someone the instant you meet them?\nWhen that happens, you know it’s not because of what they said or did. It’s some kind of signal you read in their facial expression, vocal tone, or body language.\nSurprisingly, researchers have found that we are quite accurate with these instantaneous assessments about other people.\nThe simple fact is, you know things about a person the second you meet them. And you react to these unspoken signals automatically.\nIf you’re good at reading people, you may not find it surprising to learn that men and women notice different kinds of signals when interacting with a potential mate.\nTo skip ahead to the video that explains the unusual pattern of signals men look for in a romantic relationship, just follow this link.It explains the hidden signal that either repels a man or makes him feel irresistibly attracted to you. Otherwise, keep reading to learn about a particular signal you’re broadcasting to men all the time (whether you know it or not).\nIt’s probably not what you would expect.\nYou see, there’s a specific kind of body language men simply can’t ignore.\nIt’s a signal that can spark romantic feelings. Or it can repel him, depending on what he’s reading from your nonverbal cues.\nWould you like to know what it is?\nMen Are Extremely Sensitive to Something in Your Body Language That You Would Never Expect. Women often ask me for the words to make a man want you. But the secret to make someone fall in love with you goes a bit deeper. In fact, your ability to broadcast the right non-verbal message makes all the difference when it comes to attracting the kind of man you want.\nIf you’ve been attracting attention from guys who fail to connect with you on a deep, emotional level, I may be able to show you why.\nYou’re probably sending out just one very confusing signal\u0026hellip;without even realizing it.\nWith the wrong signal, you end up with this: Attention from the wrong kind of guys. The ones you aren’t interested in. Initial attraction that later fades with the one guy you really wanted to attract. A slow and painful death for the attraction and passion in your existing relationship. But with a slight adjustment, you could be sending the right signal all the time. And you’d end up getting results more like this:\nPassion that intensifies the longer you’re together A guy who clearly feels protective of you A deep feeling of private exclusivity as he lets you into his inner world The difference can be dramatic. And it all comes down to this one signal I’m about to show you. In order to explain this signal, think of yourself as a radio tower.\nYou are constantly broadcasting a message to the men in your life. And there’s one “channel” he can’t tune out. That’s because men have emotional “antennas” designed specifically to detect this one kind of signal.\nReady to find out which signal I’m talking about? Ok, here it is. He reads your nonverbal cues to find out where you “rank him” compared with other men.\nHe reads your body language to see how he measures up in your eyes. Does she respect me? Or am I just her play thing?\nDoes she look up to me in some ways? Does she value me compared to other men? Or is she just settling?\nWhy are men so sensitive to this one signal? Because, oddly enough, this signal tells him how you compare him to other men. So it influences how he feels about himself whenever he’s around you.\nAnd it’s amazing how much this one signal affects his emotions.\nYou see, in relationships, people don’t tell us what we really want to know. We have to listen to what’s written between the lines.\nThis kind of “listening” determines how we feel about each person we meet. And when it comes to romantic relationships, it tells us far more than spoken words.\nNow tell me this. Which man would you rather commit to for life? A man who compliments your beauty but seems to have difficulty keeping his eyes off other women? Or a man who is reserved with his compliments, but seems to have eyes only for you?\nThe truth is, no one wants to end up with someone who is just settling. Instead, you want to feel desired.\nMen are no different. But what makes men feel desired is very different from what makes women feel desired.\nFor example, research shows men often confuse love and respect. A man does not want to be loved by a romantic partner unless she also holds him in high regard compared with other men.\nOtherwise, it just feels like motherly love. That’s not what he wants. It’s not how he wants to perceive himself in his primary relationship.\nAnd that’s why\u0026hellip;\nWomen often send mixed signals to the guy they’re interested in without even knowing it. It happens accidentally. And I have to tell you, it’s not your fault.\nSociety has changed too fast for men and women to adapt to the rapid changes. We are left scrambling.\nIn nearly every culture there used to be a clear set of expectations. Those expectations guided men and women through the process of connecting with a lifelong partner.\nDemonstrations of mutual admiration were built into the process of courtship. But those clear expectations are a thing of the past. These days, each couple has to invent their own path, dancing around unspoken expectations and feelings of uncertainty.\nAnd there’s something that often gets lost in our modern version of courtship.\nI’m talking about the ancient art of communicating desire through the language of admiration. It’s where the phrase, “You have an admirer” came from.\nHe doesn’t want you to settle. He wants to feel like you see him as the ultimate catch.\nOtherwise, it deflates his ego. And with it, his passion for the relationship deflates too.\nHe just can’t picture himself with a woman who looks up to other men more than she looks up to him.\nBut this is where things get confusing.\nMany women want to make their man feel loved. But a woman’s idea of loving communication is very different than a man’s.\nHow do you communicate your true feelings to a man? And why are men so sensitive to tiny signals about where you rank him compared with other men?\nTo dive a little deeper into that particular question, I put together a video presentation on the topic.\nIt explains the most powerful signals you can use to grab a man’s attention.\nAfter watching this video, many women are surprised to learn how much control they have over a man’s self-esteem.\nAnd even more surprised by how easy it is to make someone cherish you and want to invest in the relationship.\nMany of us have a tendency to buy gifts of the sort we would like to receive ourselves. It can be like that with love. We try to love our partner the way we want to be loved.\nSo you make him feel special. Yet he seems unaffected by that. You speak your own native love language to him. Apparently, he speaks another.\nBut I’m here to tell you about one incredible, universal method you can use to grab his attention by showing that you get what he craves most.\nClick here now to discover an unfair advantage with men. Help him to finally see you as the one.\nResearch References: Harry\u0026rsquo;s Masculinity Report 2018 https://s3.amazonaws.com/harrys-cdnx-prod/manual/Harry%27s\u0026#43;Masculinity\u0026#43;Report%2C\u0026#43;USA\u0026#43;2018.pdf - Men are happiest when a part of something where they feel needed and valued.\nAnderson, Cameron \u0026amp; Hildreth, John \u0026amp; Howland, Laura.
