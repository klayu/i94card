The MBTI stands for Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. It is an assessment of personality based on questions about a person’s preferences in four domains: focusing outward or inward; attending to sensory information or adding interpretation; deciding by logic or by situation; and making judgments or remaining open to information1. The MBTI is widely used in the United States and other countries by employers, career counselors, and other professionals.

## Here are the 16 personality types
The goal of the test is to find your personality type. You may be surprised what you find out.

* ISTJ - The Inspector: “I’m not arguing. I’m just explaining why I’m right.”
* ISFJ - The Protector: “I’m not bossy. I’m just trying to help you do it right.”
* INFJ - The Counselor: “I’m not weird. I’m just limited edition.”
* INTJ - The Mastermind: “I’m not always right, but I’m never wrong.”
* ISTP - The Craftsman: “I don’t always have a plan, but when I do, it usually works.”
* ISFP - The Composer: “I don’t always know what I want, but I know what I don’t want.”
* INFP - The Healer: “I’m not lazy. I’m just conserving energy.”
* INTP - The Architect: “I’m not arguing. I’m just explaining why you’re wrong.”
* ESTP - The Dynamo: “I don’t always have a plan, but when I don’t, I make one up on the spot.”
