**Introverted Disney Characters and Their Personality Types: Part 1 of a Two-Part Series**

Why do Disney characters hold such a special place in our hearts? 

Perhaps it's because we find a reflection of ourselves in their stories, particularly in the introverted characters like Jiminy Cricket, Alice in Wonderland, Pocahontas, and Merlin. For those who know their Myers-Briggs personality types, you might discover a connection to some of these beloved figures. In this blog post, we'll explore the introverts (I) among Disney's vibrant animated characters and shed light on their unique traits.

INTP: Alice in Wonderland
*Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking and Perceiving*

In the Disney film bearing her name, Alice in Wonderland embodies the INTP personality. Sitting by the river, Alice encounters a white rabbit donning a waistcoat and a pocket watch, sparking her adventurous spirit. Intrigued, she follows the rabbit down a rabbit hole, embarking on a journey through the whimsical realm of Wonderland.

As an introverted, intuitive, thinking, and perceiving character, she relies on her well-developed intuition to explore creative possibilities and observe her surroundings with a quiet and private demeanor.

INFP: Belle
*Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling and Perceiving*

![Belle](/belleINFP.jpg)

The Disney film "Beauty and the Beast" introduces us to Belle, an INFP who finds herself magically transported to a world where she meets an enchanted beast. Not aware of the prince's true identity, Belle's love becomes the key to breaking the spell and restoring the prince to his human form. 

INFPs, like Belle, are soft-spoken idealists with a willingness to embrace new experiences and a strong set of personal values guiding their actions. Although they adhere to their own moral codes, they avoid imposing their beliefs on others, opting for assertiveness when necessary and striving to uphold their deeply rooted code of honor.



ISFJ: Jiminy Cricket 
*Introverted, Sensing, Feeling and Judging*

![Jiminy Cricket](/JiminyCricketISFJ.jpg)

In the Disney classic "Pinocchio," we encounter the charming ISFJ, Jiminy Cricket, who assumes the role of Pinocchio's conscience. Jiminy accompanies the wooden boy on his adventurous journey while sharing wise and comical insights. 

As an introverted, sensing, feeling, and judging character, Jiminy is modest, orderly, and always ready to lend a helping hand. ISFJs invest their energy in aiding others during times of need, displaying a practical and down-to-earth approach to life, firmly rooted in the present moment and seeking harmony in every situation.


INFJ: Pocahontas 
*Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling and Judging*

![Pocahontas](/PocahantasINFJ.jpg)

Disney's animated film "Pocahontas" introduces us to INFJ Pocahontas, who crosses paths with Captain John Smith during the early colonial days. Despite her father Chief Powhatan's warnings, Pocahontas disobeys and befriends Smith, eventually rescuing him from danger. 

INFJs, like Pocahontas, are kind, generous, and supportive individuals, always ready to lend a helping hand to those in need. They exemplify integrity in everything they do, standing up for their ideals and speaking out against injustice when necessary, providing creative solutions and assistance to those facing difficulties.


INTJ: Basil
*Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking and Judging*
![Basil](/BasilINTJ.jpg)

Basil, the protagonist of Disney's "The Great Mouse Detective," is an INTJ with extraordinary intelligence and determination. A skilled and resourceful mouse, Basil never shies away from challenging situations. While typically calm and composed, he can display moments of moodiness when things don't go as planned. 

INTJs, known for their independence and confident nature, occasionally face misunderstanding due to their straightforwardness, which they intend as encouragement for others' improvement. These natural organizers often rise to leadership positions, adept at seeing the bigger picture.

ISTJ: Li Shang
*Introvert, Sensing, Thinking and Judging*

![Li Shang](/li-shangISTJ.jpg)
Captain Li Shang from Disney's "Mulan" epitomizes the ISTJ personality. An efficient and no-nonsense military leader, Li Shang can be stern in delivering his messages to subordinates. Meeting Mulan challenges his traditional views about women. Despite social awkwardness, he admires her bravery and expresses it in his own unique way. 

ISTJs are responsible, private individuals who rely on concrete information to make decisions, demonstrating cordiality when appropriate while remaining true introverts at heart.


ISFP: Pumbaa 
*Introverted, Sensitive, Feeling and Perceiving*

![Pumbaa](/PumbaaISFP-1.png);

In "The Lion King," ISFP Pumbaa, the lovable warthog, shines as a devoted and loyal friend. While sometimes childlike in demeanor, Pumbaa proves to be the brains behind the duo's adventures. This open-hearted character courageously rescues Simba, demonstrating a compassionate nature. 

ISFPs, more in tune with their emotions and surroundings than most, exhibit a love for life and curiosity about everything they encounter. Their gentle and encouraging disposition can be overlooked or taken advantage of by more assertive personalities.

ISTP: Tinker Bell 
*Introverted, Sensing, Thinking and Perceiving*

![Tinkerbell](/TinkerbellISTP.jpg);

The famous fairy Tinker Bell, a beloved character in various Disney films, embodies the ISTP personality. Fearless and determined, Tinker Bell stands up for her friends, although her tactfulness may sometimes fall short. Known for her tinkering skills, she adeptly fixes and invents things, providing aid to her companions. 

ISTPs, as keen observers of life, remain logical and adaptable in any situation, particularly reliable in times of immediate action. Preferring efficient methods to achieve their goals, they occasionally overlook less pertinent details while maintaining a composed exterior even when things go awry.
