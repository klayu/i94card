**Animals are such agreeable friends.  They ask no questions. They pass no criticisms.**
                                                                    *—George Eliot*

If you have a dog or cat you’re close to, you know what unconditional love is. You give it freely and you get it in return.

We might do well to apply the same principle to our human companions, appreciating the bond of love between us and avoiding judgments.
